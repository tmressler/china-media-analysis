(AP Photo/Richard Drew)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — As lawmakers debate whether to ban TikTok nationwide, its Chinese parent company has introduced a new app that’s already getting some traction. </p><p>The app, called Lemon8, is likely to face some of the same scrutiny as TikTok, which has been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew-security-risk-cc36f36801d84fc0652112fa461ef140">dogged by claims</a> the Chinese government could force its parent company ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or push misinformation on the platform. </p><p>TikTok maintains that hasn't happened. And it’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-ceo-congressional-hearing-bytedance-china-44d948c5b0ba18e2a714e0fa62d52779">attempting to convince lawmakers</a> it can keep user data safe.</p><p>Meanwhile, ByteDance is pressing ahead with its expansion plans. Here’s what you need to know about the company’s new app:</p><p>WHAT IS LEMON8?</p><p>Lemon8 is a photo-based app that resembles a mixture of Instagram and Pinterest, and is sprinkled with videos that look like the ones posted on TikTok. Social marketing experts say the app is also reminiscent of the Chinese social media and e-commerce giant Xiaohongshu, which translates to “little red book.” </p><p>Like TikTok, Lemon8's main feed features a “following” section that lets users look at content from creators they follow, as well as a “For You” section that recommends other posts. It also segments posts under different categories, like fashion, beauty and food, and allows users to explore content in other ways.</p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="054428fd24435bc34f6c2d62186122c9">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Similar to TikTok and other social media sites, Lemon8 collects user data, such as IP address, browsing history, device identifiers and other information. </p><p>Both the Apple and Google Play app stores list its owner as Heliophilia Pte. Ltd., a Singapore-based company that shares the same address as ByteDance and TikTok. </p><p>HOW POPULAR IS IT?</p><p>Lemon8 was first launched in Asian markets in 2020 and has already made headway in countries like Thailand and Japan, with roughly 7.4 million and 5 million downloads respectively, according to the app analytics company data.ai.</p><p>It was introduced in the U.S. in February with little fanfare, but all that changed when media organizations started paying closer attention and some TikTok influencers began promoting it. </p><p>As of Sunday, the app had 290,000 downloads in the U.S., the vast majority of which happened in late March, according to data.ai. It’s also listed as one of the most popular apps on Apple's app store. </p><p>Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at Influencer Marketing Factory, said ByteDance reached out to her company in late February and gave a lengthy presentation about the app and how influencers can use it. She said the agency, which connects brands with influencers, is recommending that influencers try out the app but isn’t doing the same with brands since Lemon8’s user base is still relatively small. </p><p>It also remains to be seen if the app will take off more organically or flop. The last five years have been littered with social media platforms that got a lot of hype, only to vanish in the end, said Brendan Gahan, partner and chief social officer at the creative agency Mekanism. He pointed to examples like BeReal and Clubhouse, which garnered a lot of attention in the past two years before users turned their attention elsewhere. </p><p>“Social app success is difficult to achieve and harder to maintain,” Gahan said. </p><p>WHAT HAS BYTEDANCE SAID ABOUT THE APP?</p><p>ByteDance did not reply to a request for an interview about how it plans to grow Lemon8. But the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-china-biden-bytedance-data-misinformation-02b59e4a6611ce97c775da19de31d7ad">company's general counsel Erich Andersen noted in an interview with the Associated Press</a> at a cybersecurity conference last week that it will continue to develop the app. </p><p>“We’re obviously going to do our best with the Lemon8 app to comply with U.S. law and to make sure we do the right thing here,” said Andersen, who also serves as TikTok's general counsel. “But I think we got a long way to go with that application — it’s pretty much a startup phase.”</p><p>As part of that work, ByteDance is already seeking job applicants for a few U.S.-based roles that will help grow the app's partnerships with influencers on beauty, food, health and other topics.</p><p>WHAT ELSE IS BYTEDANCE DOING?</p><p>Another app owned by ByteDance, called CapCut, is also listed on Apple's app store as one of the most popular apps in the U.S. </p><p>CapCut markets itself as an “all-in-one” video editing tool that allows users to cut or speed up their content, and do other things like add filters and music. </p><p>Data.ai, the app analytics company, said that app was released globally in April 2020, roughly a year after it was introduced in China. As of Sunday, the group said the editing tool had been downloaded 60 million times in the U.S. and 940 million globally.</p><p>ARE LAWMAKERS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE OTHER APPS?</p><p>There is support for a bipartisan bill in the Senate, called the RESTRICT Act, that does not call out TikTok but would give the Commerce Department power to review and potentially restrict foreign threats to technology platforms. But it has faced some pushback from privacy advocates and ring-wing commentators who argue the legislation is too vague and could be abused. </p><p>Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, who sponsored the bill along with Republican Sen. John Thune, said in a prepared statement that the legislation would make it easier to go after other risky apps like Lemon8. </p><p>“For too long, our government has been playing a game of Whac-A-Mole when it comes to addressing the various foreign technology threats popping up all around us," said Warner, D-Va. "The RESTRICT Act would establish a risk-based, intelligence-informed process to evaluate and mitigate the risks posed by tech from adversarial nations, whether that be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-technology-donald-trump-national-security-federal-communications-commission-6904d9fc598321fadc8bccb430efd800">Huawei</a>, TikTok, Lemon8, or the next viral technology product pushed by an authoritarian nation.”</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu)</p></figcaption></figure>      <p>SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) — Risking China's anger, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy hosted Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday as a “great friend of America" in a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-president-tsai-mccarthy-china-4c733ac48cecdb3cc1ec1d3910027d3d">fraught show of U.S. support</a> at a rare high-level, bipartisan meeting on U.S. soil.</p><p>Speaking carefully to avoid unnecessarily escalating tensions with Beijing, Tsai and McCarthy steered clear of calls from hard-liners in the U.S. for a more confrontational stance toward China in defense of self-ruled Taiwan. </p><p>Instead, the two leaders stood side by side in a show of unity at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California, acknowledging China's threats against the island government but speaking only of maintaining longstanding U.S. policy.</p><p>“America’s support for the people of Taiwan will remain resolute, unwavering and bipartisan,” McCarthy said at a news conference later.</p><p>McCarthy evoked Reagan's peace-through-strength approach to foreign relations and emphasized “this is a bipartisan meeting of members of Congress,” not any one political party. He said U.S.-Taiwan ties are stronger than at any other point in his life.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>He and Tsai spoke to reporters with Reagan's Air Force One as a backdrop.</p><p>She said the “unwavering support reassures the people of Taiwan that we are not isolated."</p><div id="afs:Card:344160070650" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="7f33d0bb7c307bb26da39b39df688b71">Hub peek embed (Taiwan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Still, the formal trappings of the meeting, and the senior rank of some of the elected officials in the delegation from Congress, threatened to run afoul of China’s position that any interaction between U.S. and Taiwanese officials is a challenge to China’s claim of sovereignty over the island.</p><p>More than a dozen Democratic and Republican lawmakers, including the House's third-ranking Democrat, joined Republican McCarthy for the daylong talks.</p><p>During a private session they spoke of the importance of Taiwan’s self-defense, of fostering robust trade and economic ties and supporting the island government’s ability to participate in the international community, Tsai said.</p><p>They made no mention of calls from hard-liners in and out of Congress for a greater U.S. commitment to Taiwan’s defense if China should attack. </p><p>Tsai said she stressed to lawmakers Taiwan’s commitment “to defending the peaceful status quo where the people in Taiwan may continue to thrive in a free and open society.”</p><div id="c09efa9ee7d64a6da34f3790c0b3e96d" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>But she also warned, “It is no secret that today the peace that we have maintained and the democracy which have worked hard to build are facing unprecedented challenges."</p><p>“We once again find ourselves in a world where democracy is under threat and the urgency of keeping the beacon of freedom shining cannot be understated.”</p><p>The United States broke off official ties with Taiwan in 1979 while formally establishing diplomatic relations with the Beijing government. The U.S. acknowledges a “one-China” policy in which Beijing lays claim to Taiwan, but it does not endorse China’s claim to the island and remains Taiwan’s key provider of military and defense assistance.</p><p>For Tsai, this was the most sensitive stop on a weeklong journey meant to shore up alliances with the U.S. and Central America. The U.S. House speaker is second in line of succession to the president. No speaker is known to have met with a Taiwan president on U.S. soil since the U.S. broke off formal diplomatic relations.</p><p>China has reacted to past trips by Taiwanese presidents through the U.S., and to past trips to Taiwan by senior U.S. officials, with shows of military force. After then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan last August, China responded with its largest live-fire drills in decades, including firing a missile over the island.</p><p>Chinese officials have pledged a sharp but unspecified response to the meeting with McCarthy.</p><p>Later Wednesday, China said it “firmly opposes and strongly condemns” Tsai’s visit, in a statement by China's official Xinhua News Agency.</p><p>China will take “resolute and forceful measures to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the statement said, citing an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesperson. It urged the U.S. “not to walk further down the wrong and dangerous road.”</p><p>There was no sign of a large-scale military response as of Thursday morning as China had done previously.</p><p>Chinese vessels were engaged in a joint patrol and inspection operation in the Taiwan Strait that will last three days, state media said Thursday morning. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said Wednesday evening it had tracked the China’s Shandong aircraft carrier passing through the Bashi Strait, to Taiwan’s southeast. </p><p>The Biden administration insists there is nothing provocative about this visit by Tsai, which is the latest of a half-dozen to the U.S.</p><p>"Beijing should not use the transits as an excuse to take any actions, to ratchet up tensions, to further push at changing the status quo," Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Wednesday during travel in Europe.</p><p>The Taiwan president's visit to America comes as China, the U.S. and its allies are strengthening their military positions and readiness for any confrontation between the two sides, with Taiwan and its claim to sovereignty a main flashpoint. </p><p>Confrontation between the U.S. and China, a rising power increasingly seeking to assert its influence abroad under President Xi Jinping, surged with Pelosi's visit and again this winter with the cross-U.S. journey of what the U.S. says was a Chinese spy balloon.</p><p>Democratic Rep. Pelosi said in a statement, "Today’s meeting between President Tsai of Taiwan and Speaker McCarthy is to be commended for its leadership, its bipartisan participation and its distinguished and historic venue.”</p><p>Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war and have no official relations, although they are linked by billions of dollars in trade and investment. </p><p>For their part, Taiwanese officials in the United States – and Taiwanese presidents on a succession of visits – aim for a delicate balance of maintaining warm relations with their powerful American allies, without overstepping their in-between status in the U.S, or unnecessarily provoking China.</p><p>To that end, no Taiwanese flag flies over the former Taiwan Embassy in Washington. Taiwanese presidents call their stops in the U.S. “transits” rather than visits, and they steer clear of Washington.</p><p>McCarthy, the newly elected House speaker, is making an early foray into foreign policy.</p><p>Joining him for the meeting were the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on a new House Select Committee on China, along with the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee that handles tax policy important to Taiwan, among others.</p><p>Seated to McCarthy’s right was the third-ranking House Democrat, Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, who spoke of the long history of U.S.-Taiwan cooperation and an “overwhelming bipartisan commitment” in Congress, working with the Biden administration, to strengthen the relationship.</p><p>___</p><p>Mascaro and Knickmeyer reported from Washington. AP writers Nomaan Merchant and Fu Ting in Washington, Huizhong Wu in Taipei and Matthew Lee in Brussels contributed.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BANGKOK (AP) — More than 60 self-exiled members of a Chinese Christian church who were detained in Thailand after receiving U.N. refugee status will be deported by next week, probably to a third country, officials said Wednesday. </p><p>Deputy national police chief Surachate Hakparn said representatives of Thailand’s Foreign Ministry and Immigration Bureau were holding talks with the U.N. Refugee Agency and the U.S. Embassy to discuss the fate of the 63 members of the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church who were taken to court in the coastal city of Pattaya last Friday.</p><p>“Within the next week, they will definitely be deported. What we don’t know is which country they will be deported to,” Surachate told The Associated Press.</p><p>The members of the church, also known as the Mayflower Church, were granted refugee status by the U.N. agency after their arrival in Thailand last year. They say they faced unbearable harassment in China and are seeking asylum in the United States.</p><p>Prior to their arrival in Thailand, the church members had fled to South Korea’s Jeju island in October 2019 and stayed there for nearly three years, but decided to leave as it became clear that prospects for refuge there were dim.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>An Immigration Bureau official with knowledge of Wednesday’s multi-agency discussions said the Thai authorities would “find a way” for the church members to be sent to a third country.</p><div id="afs:Card:148376116072" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9c1853fb056f6551059c7b0518962d88">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“The Immigration Bureau will continue to take care of them on humanitarian grounds in the meantime,” said the official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.</p><p>The church members expected to be released after being arrested and fined last week for overstaying their visas. Instead, they were driven by bus from Pattaya to a police detention facility in Bangkok for what a police officer said was normal processing. </p><p>Surachate said the church members have been separated, with “the mothers and children” -- about half the group -- sent to the Immigration Bureau’s care facility in northern Bangkok, while the others were being kept in the bureau’s main detention center in central Bangkok.</p><p>As the group was being driven to Bangkok, the church members forced the buses to temporarily stop when they suspected they were headed to Bangkok’s international airport for repatriation to China, where they fear persecution.</p><p>Human Rights Watch issued a statement on Saturday urging the Thai government not to deport the group due to “the grave dangers facing Christians back in China.”</p><p>In its annual report last year, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom said the Chinese Communist Party requires religious groups to support its rule and political objectives, including by altering their religious teachings to conform with the party’s ideology and policy. “Both registered and unregistered religious groups and individuals who run afoul of the CCP face harassment, detention, arrest, imprisonment, and other abuses,” the commission said.</p><p>Surachate said the church members had overstayed their visas by about half a year by the time they were found by police. He said they were arrested as a result of a recent crackdown following growing reports of crimes involving Chinese citizens. </p><p>He said Thailand has a principle of not allowing people seeking refuge to stay in the country. Thailand did not ratify the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention and does not have any law addressing refugee status.</p><p>“Principally, we will not let them stay in Thailand, otherwise people from all over the world would come to Thailand,” Surachate said. “You see, they were in South Korea for years and did not receive the UNHCR paper. They did within just four months of arriving here.”</p><p>Thailand has frequently granted shelter to people from neighboring countries fleeing war.</p><p>However, not everyone is tolerated. In 2015, Thailand sent 109 members of the Muslim Uyghur minority back to China against their will despite fears they would face official persecution and possible torture.</p><p>___</p><p>This story corrects that background on international and Thai laws was not mentioned by Surachate. </p>]]></description>

He noted China proposed a peace plan in February and that while France doesn't fully agree with it, the plan "shows a will to commit toward the resolution of the conflict.”</p><p>Meanwhile, NATO’s 31 member countries warned Wednesday of “severe consequences” should China start sending weapons and ammunition to Russia.</p><div id="45c81319a87b4a7a8758da166aba4032" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“Allies have been clear that any provision of lethal aid by China to Russia would be a historic mistake, with profound implications,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after chairing a meeting of the organization’s foreign ministers in Brussels.</p><p>Stoltenberg declined to say what the implications of such a move might be, but warned only that it would involve “severe consequences.”</p><p>“At a time when Beijing and Moscow are pushing back against the rules-based international order, it is even more important that we continue to stand together,” he said.</p><p>Last week, von der Leyen warned the European Union must be prepared to develop measures to protect trade and investment that China might exploit for its own security and military purposes.</p><p>Thierry Breton, EU commissioner for internal market, said Monday on French news broadcaster FranceInfo the message to Chinese authorities is that they “must stop trying to play one country against another.”</p><p>Macron also said “several major deals” were due to be signed between French and Chinese companies during the visit. He was accompanied by more than 50 French CEOs including from Airbus, railway equipment manufacturer Alstom and energy giant EDF.</p><p>A French official said last week negotiations were underway on a potential deal with Airbus that would come on top of China’s 2019 order for 300 aircraft.</p><p>Macron said he will push for “working in partnership” with China on climate. He said France will organize a global conference on the protection of oceans in 2025 and said China should be part of these efforts.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is pressing its case for a new approach to global trade, arguing that America’s traditional reliance on promoting free trade pacts failed to anticipate China’s brass-knuckled brand of capitalism and the possibility a major power like Russia would go to war against one of its trading partners.</p><p>In a speech Wednesday at American University, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai called for a strategy of what's known as “friend-shoring’’ — building up supply chains among allied countries and reducing dependence on geopolitical rivals such as China. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-semiconductor-trade-violations-e0564c045bdc33a0c5fe0c4cc795db8b">Rising tension with Beijing</a> and supply-chain bottlenecks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the risks of relying too heavily on Chinese suppliers.</p><p>“Trade policy cannot solve all the wrongs in the world, but it can help more people both at home and abroad share the benefits of increasing economic growth,” Tai said. “Let us not be content with reruns of the old. Let us write a new script for a brighter tomorrow.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The rethinking of trade goes beyond the simple issue of lowering tariffs and signing broad pacts. In her speech, Tai noted the elimination of regulatory barriers last year that allowed U.S. farmers to export potatoes to Mexico, ongoing talks to form <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-japan-modi-kishida-meeting-2ccec67ae7fa4b26090316d3d98a5b59">an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework</a> that could possibly counter China in Asia, and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-electric-vehicles-critical-minerals-batteries-8fed96f133306bb1bdc8ac04352cfc3e">recent agreement on critical minerals</a> with Japan.</p><div id="afs:Card:148376116072" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="98db7932b046ac66556e50b1afff27a8">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Tai said that the Biden administration settled "long-standing disputes" with the European Union to focus on shared goals such as a 2021 agreement to put tariffs on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-g-20-summit-business-rome-ursula-von-der-leyen-8640b375e34d89c436c94c9002e63da3">“dirty” steel and aluminum</a> produced by China, while supporting the mills in Europe and North America. </p><p>The administration is also seeking to work with allies to reform the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based agency that enforces global trade rules. The WTO has been crippled for more than three years: Its top appeals court hasn’t functioned since the United States blocked the appointment of new judges to the panel. The U.S. and others had argued that the WTO was ill-equipped to deal with China’s unconventional blend of capitalism and state control of the economy.</p><p>“We did not anticipate that China would end up being so globally dominant in so many ways,’’ Tai said in an interview Tuesday ahead of her speech.</p><p>When China joined the WTO in 2001, many in the U.S. assumed that it would open its economy and even allow for more political freedom. Instead, China <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-shanghai-business-0c0f7946bc3c08db1df13eb78911f4aa">ran up huge trade surpluses</a> with the United States as it became a leading center of manufacturing and the world's second largest economy. The Chinese government took advantage of its access to the U.S. market while often discriminating against U.S. and other foreign firms. And China has continued to crack down on political dissent.</p><p>For decades after World War II, U.S. trade policy was based partly on the idea that increased global trade would reduce tensions among countries, that nations that did business with each other would not go to war. But Russian President Vladimir “Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine flies in the face of how we thought things would work,’’ Tai said.</p><p>The Biden administration has upset many of its traditional allies, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-us-biden-trade-dispute-green-economy-16ac7c6767c0717078e13fa5187f1ec3">especially in Europe,</a> by keeping some of former President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies and by aggressively promoting Made-in-America manufacturing. </p><p>But Tai insisted the United States wanted to work with allies to build a better, fairer world trading system. The problem, she told reporters, is that U.S. allies are only offering criticisms, instead of putting together their own plans to overhaul the trade system</p><p>“We’re the only ones who are out there putting forward an affirmative vision,” she said. </p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/J.

The Republican leader has focused more on domestic politics at home than international concerns abroad. Outspoken, even bellicose, against China, McCarthy chose to send a more measured and diplomatic nod of support to Taiwan with the meeting.</p><p>“It’s a very good debut,” said Newt Gingrich, the Republican former speaker who led a delegation to Taiwan decades ago and advises McCarthy. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“I think it’s a useful thing to communicate to a country — that’s under enormous pressure — that they have real allies,” Gingrich said ahead of the meeting. The Taiwanese, he said, will “see it as a morale boost.”</p><div id="afs:Card:344160070650" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="4c733ac48cecdb3cc1ec1d3910027d3d">Hub peek embed (Taiwan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The private meeting between Tsai and McCarthy came against the very public backdrop of heightened U.S. focus on China over its actions at home and abroad, particularly China's potential aggression enforcing its claims over the island of Taiwan. </p><p>The Biden administration is watching China’s interactions with Russia vis-a-vis <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-security-aid-billions-e02b957dc15fcb1004bf54a2232c1f5e">the war in Ukraine</a>, while Congress is probing China over a host of issues, from the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-china-beijing-f56da0416e019a2d32217af5334fc4cb">Chinese spy balloon</a> that floated over North America earlier this year to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-origins-china-wuhan-intelligence-7018f8016c7346cfaa8193933ec10063">origins of the COVID-19 pandemic</a> to Chinese social media giant <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-ceo-congressional-hearing-bytedance-china-44d948c5b0ba18e2a714e0fa62d52779">TikTok’s data privacy practices</a>.</p><p>The United States broke off official ties with Taiwan in 1979, when it formally established diplomatic relations with the Beijing government. While the U.S. acknowledges the “one-China” policy in which Beijing lays claim to the island of Taiwan as territory, the U.S. does not endorse China's claim to the island and remains Taiwan’s key provider of military and defense assistance.</p><p>The session with McCarthy, who as House speaker is second in line of succession to the president, was Tsai’s most high-level U.S. visit during her visit, which also included a stop in New York last week. At that time, she met Friday with three U.S. senators — Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., all members of the Senate Armed Services Committee -- and with House Democratic leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries.</p><p>Details on the event Wednesday, which included a bipartisan showing of Republican and Democratic lawmakers, had been closely held, a reminder of the pressures on her island government under the watchful eye of China. </p><p>It was the first known visit between a House speaker and a Taiwan president on American territory since the U.S. broke off formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, experts said. </p><p>“It’s particularly an opportunity to demonstrate how strong the relationship with the United States is,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, the managing director of the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund.</p><p>“Of course, Congress is part of that," she said. Because the lack of formal diplomatic relations greatly limits any interaction between Taiwan and U.S. leaders, "it becomes even more important that they have meetings with members of Congress.”</p><p>The Chinese government has expressed its displeasure ahead of Tsai’s meeting with McCarthy, and threatened countermeasures over any contact with the House speaker. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-tsai-mccarthy-meeting-c769ade44eb65f143ec95bb88344ec41">said Tuesday</a> it will follow the developments and “resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.” </p><p>Chinese state media announced Wednesday morning that vessels have started conducting a joint patrol and inspection operation in the central and northern waters of the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said it had also tracked the People’s Liberation Army’s Shandong aircraft carrier passing through the Bashi Strait, to Taiwan’s southeast.</p><p>McCarthy, a sandwich shop operator in Bakersfield, California, before working as a congressional aide and being elected to Congress, is not known for vast foreign policy experience.</p><p>Unlike <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/nancy-pelosi">Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi</a>, who used her speaker's gavel as a calling card to bring U.S. influence and aid around the globe, McCarthy is focusing his speakership more inward on the domestic needs of Americans.</p><p>While McCarthy has led congressional delegation trips abroad — to Israel, for example, and to Normandy, France, to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II — and had expressed interest in visiting Taiwan, he had not yet made plans for his own trip. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-asia-beijing-malaysia-a5a6acc391511c99b1b4c2d69e67b133">Pelosi's 2022 Taiwan visit</a> drew fierce rebuke from China with live-fire drills that included firing missiles over the island. In December, China sent planes and ships toward Taiwan in a 24-hour display of force.</p><p>With the new speaker, it was decided that Tsai and McCarthy would meet in California.</p><p>McCarthy’s more cautious foreign policy approach makes sense politically for the new leader as he tries to steer a Republican party that has become <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-us-republican-party-texas-michael-mccaul-114e61bdd752d387a3df813638dab68a">more isolationist</a>, and less willing to engage the U.S. abroad as an earlier generation of lawmakers. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-government-e986c620149b72030bb418bd5fadb4a2">McCarthy barely won his own position as House speaker</a> in January after a grueling party election that took 15 public ballots to win over his reluctant hard-right colleagues — a sizable faction of skeptics who could conceivably vote to oust McCarthy over any wrong turn.</p><p>Still, McCarthy stood up a new House Select Committee on China, drawing wide-ranging bipartisan support from Democrats, executing a long-running idea of his to drill down on the China’s rising influence in the U.S. and the world.</p><p>The venue of the Reagan library and ranch in Simi Valley, near where McCarthy was raised in California's Central Valley, provides an evocative setting for him to try to lead more substantively on the global stage.</p><p>“He's grown up with Reagan Library,” Gingrich said. “It communicates strength, optimism, deep patriotism and principles that worked.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Huizhong Wu contributed from Taipei.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Prosecutor: Chinese man charged in $1B fraud 'sociopathic']]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK (AP) — A Chinese businessman charged in a $1 billion fraud was labeled “sociopathic” by a prosecutor as a judge heard arguments Tuesday over whether any bail conditions could ensure he'd not flee or engage in illegal business practices while awaiting trial.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres did not immediately rule whether bail can be set for Guo Wengui, 54, who was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/guo-wengui-chinese-businessman-fraud-d49b80f5f78ab30570a67885e91a0a05">arrested three weeks ago</a> on charges including wire and securities fraud.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president asked his Chinese counterpart for help Tuesday in halting chemicals from China used by Mexican drug dealers to illegally produce fentanyl, while also complaining of “rude” U.S. pressure to curb the drug trade.</p><p>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has previously said that fentanyl is America’s problem and is caused by “a lack of hugs” in U.S. families. On Tuesday he doubled down on those themes, but went further, venting in a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping about “rude threats” from U.S. legislators over the drug trade.</p><p>López Obrador complained about calls in the United States to designate Mexican drug gangs as terrorist organizations. Some Republicans have said they favor using the U.S. military to crack down on the Mexican cartels.</p><p>“Unjustly, they are blaming us for problems that in large measure have to do with their loss of values, their welfare crisis,” López Obrador wrote to Xi in the letter published Tuesday. “These positions are in themselves a lack of respect and a threat to our sovereignty, and moreover they are based on an absurd, manipulative, propagandistic and demagogic attitude.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Only after several paragraphs of venting, López Obrador brings up China’s exports of fentanyl precursors, and asked him to help stop shipments of chemicals that Mexican cartels import from China.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="694a4b5c0ed67d5c9ac828ef956416bb">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“I write to you, President Xi Jinping, not to ask your help on these rude threats, but to ask you for humanitarian reasons to help us by controlling the shipments of fentanyl,” the Mexican president wrote.</p><p>China has taken some steps to limit fentanyl exports, but mislabeled or harder-to-detect precursor chemicals continue to pour out of Chinese factories.</p><p>It was not immediately clear if Xi had received the letter or if he had responded to it. López Obrador has a history of writing confrontational letters to world leaders without getting a response.</p><p>López Obrador has angrily denied that fentanyl is produced in Mexico. However, his own administration has acknowledged finding dozens of labs where it is produced, mainly in the northern state of Sinaloa.</p><p>Most illegal fentanyl is pressed by Mexican cartels into counterfeit pills made to look like other medications like Xanax, oxycodone or Percocet, or mixed into other drugs, including heroin and cocaine. Many people who die of overdoses in the United States do not know they are taking fentanyl.</p><p>Over the last week, López Obrador has fixated on press reports stating that the National Basketball Association had offered in talks with the players’ union to stop testing or penalizing players for using marijuana.</p><p>The Mexican president took that as evidence of U.S. social and moral decay, even though Mexico has legalized the growing of marijuana for personal and medical use.</p><p>“We are seeing the the basketball league has authorized players to smoke marijuana,” López Obrador said. “How can that be? Imagine, in sports! It shouldn’t be allowed anywhere.”</p><p>López Obrador doubled down on his advice to strengthen family values in the United States on Tuesday. He claims that close-knit families has allowed Mexico to avoid a fentanyl crisis, though the country has a huge problem with domestic methamphetamine consumption.</p><p>“I would tell them for example, to keep their children at home longer, don’t kick them out of the hose, keep them (at home) for two or three years more,” he said during a news conference.</p><p>Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid trafficked by Mexican cartels that has been blamed for about 70,000 overdose deaths per year in the United States.</p><p>Experts say that Mexican cartels are making so much money now from the U.S. market that they see no need to sell fentanyl in their home market.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BRUSSELS (AP) — On the eve of a major European Union diplomatic foray into China, the bloc's foreign policy chief on Tuesday lashed out at Beijing for its support of Russia amid the invasion of Ukraine, and called it “a blatant violation” of its United Nations commitments. </p><p>“There cannot be siding with the aggressor,” Josep Borrell said ahead of a trip to Beijing by the EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron. “There is a clear expectation from a permanent member of the (U.N.) Security Council to stand up in defense of international rules-based order and China as a moral duty to contribute to a fair peace.” </p><p>Standing alongside visiting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Borrell was unusually blunt in his condemnation of a nation that has increasingly moved from being an EU partner to being a rival on the global stage. </p><p>The comments set the stage for two of Europe's pre-eminent leaders to press the point that EU-China relations will pivot on Beijing's friendship with Russia. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Macron and von der Leyen are expected to warn China against sending weapons to Russia during talks with President Xi Jinping on Thursday. Just ahead of the visit, von der Leyen had a phone call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to coordinate strategy.</p><div id="afs:Card:418842279618" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="61c81520b6a97e0a90c97a2402cda5b3">Hub peek embed (apf-WorldNews) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Even if Beijing says it is neutral in the war, Xi's visit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow two weeks ago had all the visuals and speeches of a meeting among trusted friends. </p><p>“They agreed on the need to not deploy nuclear arms abroad," Borrell said of the Moscow meeting. "Some days later, Russia deployed tactical weapons, nuclear tactical weapons in Belarus,” he added, referring to an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-belarus-nuclear-weapons-2d9584534da25c00c56dbf7b14694e0e">announcement by Putin</a> of plans to deploy such weapons. “This comes, ironically, after Chinese President Xi visited Moscow and mentioned the need for peace.”</p><p>He called the prospect of deploying such weapons in Belarus Putin's “newest nuclear gamble” and said it constituted "a direct threat to European security.”</p><p>Borrell said he was looking for a change of heart in Beijing if relations were not to deteriorate. </p><p>“We have been clear with China that its position on Russia’s atrocities and war crimes will determine the quality of our relations with Beijing,” he said.</p><p>Discussions between Macron, Xi and von der Leyen will mainly focus on trade, the war in Ukraine and climate change. </p><p>The European officials are expected to underscore the importance of China’s role in supporting peace, and to tell Xi that he should engage directly with Zelenskyy following his visit to Moscow last month. They will also urge him to put pressure on Putin to stop threatening nuclear weapons use in the war against Ukraine.</p><p>Von der Leyen will ask Xi to use his influence to make sure a grain export deal that has helped bring down global food prices can be extended beyond mid-May, when it's expected to expire after Russia’s U.N. ambassador reiterated that Moscow is ready to extend the deal — but only for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-grain-fertilizer-extension-f5550e9f2dfa2a0c601d73b7d11a42db">60 days</a>, just half the 120 days in the agreement.</p><p>The EU does not expect a significant change in China’s position but believes it’s crucial to keep engaging with the superpower, notably on trade issues. </p><p>In 2022, China was the EU's third largest partner in exports of goods and the largest partner for EU imports. EU leaders want to rebalance their commercial relationship while also addressing the 27-nation bloc's dependence to China in strategic sectors such as critical raw materials, computing-related technologies, semi-conductors and clean technologies.</p>]]></description>

Her supporters lined a red carpet leading to the hotel's entrance, banging drums, chanting and holding Taiwanese flags and photos of the president. A smaller group demonstrating in favor of China gathered nearby on the sidewalk, at times chanting “One China.”</p><p>China views Taiwan as its own territory and treats any dealings between U.S. and Taiwanese officials as a challenge to its sovereignty. Tsai's tour is a bid to demonstrate that her government has international support.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Belize and Guatemala are two of just 13 countries that formally recognize Taiwan, a number that has dipped as China has put pressure on and funneled money into isolating the island. Tsai's Latin American trip comes just a week after Honduras announced it was cutting ties with Taiwan in favor of China, potentially prompted by a $300 million hydroelectric dam project in central Honduras built by a Chinese company.</p><div id="afs:Card:344160070650" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="c769ade44eb65f143ec95bb88344ec41">Hub peek embed (Taiwan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Last week, and again on Monday, China threatened with countermeasures if Tsai met with McCarthy. The Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles issued a statement Monday saying it opposed any “any form of contact” between Taiwan authorities and the U.S.</p><p>“The reality and current situation that both sides of the (Taiwan) Strait belong to one China is very clear,” the statement said.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at a daily news briefing Tuesday that China “will closely follow the developments and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.” </p><p>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it has never been part of China, and that China's recent criticism has become increasingly “absurd.”</p><p>“Taiwan, the Republic of China, is a sovereign country, and has the right to make its own determination in developing relations with other countries in the world,” it said in a statement. “It does not accept interference or suppression by any country for any reason, and will not limit itself because of intimidation or interference.”</p><p>The United States’ longstanding “one-China” policy acknowledges that the Chinese claim Taiwan as their territory. However, the U.S. does not endorse that claim and remains Taiwan’s most important provider of military hardware and other defense assistance. </p><p>China has repeatedly asserted its claim to Taiwan, though Taiwan maintains its own democratic system of government since the sides split after a civil war in 1949. </p><p>Keeping up the military pressure, China's People’s Liberation Army sent 20 warplanes toward Taiwan Monday to Tuesday as well as three warships in the latest round of exercises, which have increased significantly in recent years. </p><p>China regularly sends warplanes around the island and has at times seemingly used the exercises as a demonstration of its ire. </p><p>Last December, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-politics-china-7ca84c323b8ed15253c9cb5c04789805">China sent 71 planes and seven ships</a> toward Taiwan in a 24-hour display of force after it expressed anger at Taiwan-related provisions in a U.S. annual defense spending bill. </p><p>And last year, China responded to a visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan with the largest live-fire drills in decades that included firing a missile over the island, which had landed in Japan's exclusive economic zone.</p><p>The PLA’s increased military activity near Taiwan has raised concerns among regional governments, and also drawn greater international attention and rhetorical support for Taiwan’s defense. U.S. legislators have also started visiting Taiwan at a greater frequency, as anti-China sentiment and concerns over China's strategic position grows in Congress.</p><p>__</p><p>Associated Press journalist Eugene Garcia in Los Angeles contributed.</p>]]></description>

A surge of street protests resulted in a state visit by Britain’s King Charles III having to be postponed.</p><p>While Macron is in Beijing, French trade unions on Thursday will stage the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-macron-protests-pensions-retirement-police-3b441f92ebac633c89207e7dbd5fe697">11th round of nationwide demonstrations</a> since January. </p><p>The visit also comes amid <a href="https://apnews.com/article/g-20-summit-politics-united-states-government-china-antony-blinken-0a0469109e8776f1676d7b813e46854f">ever-rising tensions between the U.S. and China</a>, the world’s two largest economies. </p><p>Trade will also be a major focus as Macron has asked European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to join him for a meeting with Xi that's meant to show European unity especially on economic issues. The French president said last month that he took such an initiative because he is "attached to European coordination.”</p><p>Last week, von der Leyen warned the European Union must be prepared <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-china-trade-defense-security-france-spain-b994a8d5c0c1055eb9659642844feede">to develop measures to protect trade and investment</a> that China might exploit for its own security and military purposes.</p><p>China is both the EU’s commercial partner and a rival, Thierry Breton, EU Commissioner for Internal Market, said Monday on French news broadcaster FranceInfo. Breton said the message to Chinese authorities is that they “must stop trying to play one country against another.”</p><p>“Of course, China still is an important market for many European companies. But the (EU) internal market is a crucial market to China,” Breton added.</p><p>Macron will be accompanied by a delegation of over 50 CEOs including from French energy giant EDF, rail transport manufacturer Alstom and European plane-maker Airbus.</p><p>The top French official said negotiations were still being held on a potential deal with Airbus that would come on top of China’s 2019 order for 300 aircraft.</p><p>NGOs including the International Federation for Human Rights, International Campaign for Tibet and the Human Rights League have called on Macron to put human rights at the heart of his talks with Chinese authorities. </p><p>Macron “must strongly denounce privately but also publicly the repression against Chinese activists and human rights advocates, Hong Kong's people, Uyghurs and Tibetans,” France's Human Rights League President Patrick Baudouin said in a statement.</p><p>Macron's office said human rights issues will be mentioned during the visit.</p><p>Macron, who last traveled to China in 2019 before the COVID-19 crisis, is to start his trip Wednesday in Beijing with a speech to the French community. </p><p>On Thursday, he will have meetings with the head of the National People’s Congress, Zhao Leji, and China’s new No. 2 leader, Premier Li Qiang, in addition to a meeting and a state dinner with Xi in the presence of von der Leyen. </p><p>On Friday, Macron will head to the southern Chinese metropolis of Guangzhou, where Xi’s father used to work as provincial governor in the 1980s. </p><p>The French president will answer questions there from some of the 1,000 Chinese students at Sun Yat-Sen university. He will then meet Xi again for a private dinner and later meet with Chinese investors.</p><p>____ </p><p>AP journalist Nicolas Garriga contributed to the story.</p>]]></description>

Chips are the center of a “technology war,” a Chinese scientist wrote in an official journal in February.</p><p>China has its own chip foundries, but they supply only low-end processors used in autos and appliances. The U.S. government, starting under then-President Donald Trump, is cutting off access to a growing array of tools to make chips for computer servers, AI and other advanced applications. Japan and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/semiconductor-chips-china-asml-netherlands-washington-d988faf1d7f8339f9fc62a4725095798">Netherlands</a> have joined in limiting access to technology they say might be used to make weapons.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Xi, in unusually pointed language, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-relations-sabotage-development-taiwan-cb60a10bc988243af53c98f2c9e92104">accused Washington in March</a> of trying to block China’s development with a campaign of “containment and suppression.” He called on the public to “dare to fight.”</p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="58b4d9bd2ba6543a9583cc3b49a9cc57">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Despite that, Beijing has been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-technology-health-asia-china-4e66d6d2944204a5261b4bfbe0048688">slow to retaliate</a> against U.S. companies, possibly to avoid disrupting Chinese industries that assemble most of the world's smartphones, tablet computers and other consumer electronics. They import more than $300 billion worth of foreign chips every year.</p><p>The ruling Communist Party is throwing billions of dollars at trying to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-europe-china-beijing-2987b725a845e36b2a9735d9294bfb90">accelerate chip development</a> and reduce the need for foreign technology.</p><p>China’s loudest complaint: It is blocked from buying a machine available only from a Dutch company, ASML, that uses ultraviolet light to etch circuits into silicon chips on a scale measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter. Without that, Chinese efforts to make transistors faster and more efficient by packing them more closely together on fingernail-size slivers of silicon are stalled.</p><p>Making processor chips requires some 1,500 steps and technologies owned by U.S., European, Japanese and other suppliers.</p><p>“China won’t swallow everything. If damage occurs, we must take action to protect ourselves,” the Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands, Tan Jian, told the Dutch newspaper Financieele Dagblad.</p><p>“I’m not going to speculate on what that might be,” Tan said. “It won’t just be harsh words.”</p><p>The conflict has prompted warnings the world might decouple, or split into separate spheres with incompatible technology standards that mean computers, smartphones and other products from one region wouldn’t work in others. That would raise costs and might slow innovation.</p><p>“The bifurcation in technological and economic systems is deepening,” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore said at an economic forum in China last month. “This will impose a huge economic cost.” </p><p>U.S.-Chinese relations are at their lowest level in decades due to disputes over security, Beijing’s treatment of Hong Kong and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-trade-security-technology-genetics-bgi-entity-d14c4bb435e85204f1c590a62dbc4138">Muslim ethnic minorities</a>, territorial disputes and China’s multibillion-dollar trade surpluses.</p><p>Chinese industries will “hit a wall” in 2025 or 2026 if they can’t get next generation chips or the tools to make their own, said Handel Jones, a tech industry consultant.</p><p>China “will start falling behind significantly,” said Jones, CEO of International Business Strategies.</p><p>Beijing might have leverage, though, as the biggest source of batteries for electric vehicles, Jones said.</p><p>Chinese battery giant CATL supplies U.S. and Europe automakers. Ford Motor Co. plans to use CATL technology in a $3.5 billion battery factory in Michigan.</p><p>“China will strike back,” Jones said. “What the public might see is China not giving the U.S. batteries for EVs.”</p><p>On Friday, Japan increased pressure on Beijing by joining Washington in imposing controls on exports of chipmaking equipment. The announcement didn’t mention China, but the trade minister said Tokyo doesn’t want its technology used for military purposes.</p><p>A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, warned Japan that “weaponizing sci-tech and trade issues” would “hurt others as well as oneself.”</p><p>Hours later, the Chinese government announced an investigation of the biggest U.S. memory chip maker, Micron Technology Inc., a key supplier to Chinese factories. The Cyberspace Administration of China said it would look for national security threats in Micron’s technology and manufacturing but gave no details.</p><p>The Chinese military also needs semiconductors for its development of stealth fighter jets, cruise missiles and other weapons.</p><p>Chinese alarm grew after President Joe Biden in October expanded controls imposed by Trump on chip manufacturing technology. Biden also barred Americans from helping Chinese manufacturers with some processes.</p><p>To nurture Chinese suppliers, Xi’s government is stepping up support that industry experts say already amounts to as much as $30 billion a year in research grants and other subsidies.</p><p>China’s biggest maker of memory chips, Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp., or YMTC, received a 49 billion yuan ($7 billion) infusion this year from two official funds, according to Tianyancha, a financial information provider.</p><p>One was the government’s main investment vehicle, the China National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, known as the Big Fund. It was founded in 2014 with 139 billion yuan ($21 billion) and has invested in hundreds of companies.</p><p>The Big Fund launched a second entity, known as the Big Fund II, in 2019 with 200 billion yuan ($30 billion).</p><p>In January, chip manufacturer Hua Hong Semiconductor said Big Fund II would contribute 1.2 billion yuan ($175 million) for a planned 6.7 billion yuan ($975 million) wafer fabrication facility in eastern China's Wuxi.</p><p>In March, the Cabinet promised tax breaks and other support for the industry. It gave no price tag. The government also has set up “integrated circuit talent training bases” at 23 universities and six at other schools.</p><p>“Semiconductors are the ‘main battlefield’ of the current China-U.S. technology war,” Junwei Luo, a scientist at the official Institute of Semiconductors, wrote in the February issue of the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Luo called for “self-reliance and self-improvement in semiconductors.”</p><p>The scale of spending required is huge. The global industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., or <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-technology-china-asia-business-aa6d6af23b6ca4b513be2c0a28636967">TSMC</a>, is in the third year of a three-year, $100 billion plan to expand research and production.</p><p>Developers including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-united-states-government-huawei-technologies-co-ltd-district-of-columbia-business-ab63a8f31847f23b691fa705f8a4a8e2">Huawei Technologies Ltd.</a> and VeriSilicon Holdings Co. can design logic chips for smartphones as powerful as those from Intel Corp., Apple Inc., South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. or Britain’s Arm Ltd., according to industry researchers. But they cannot be manufactured without the precision technology of TSMC and other foreign foundries.</p><p>Trump in 2019 crippled Huawei’s smartphone brand by blocking it from buying U.S. chips or other technology. American officials say Huawei, China’s first global tech brand, might facilitate Chinese spying, an accusation the company denies. In 2020, the White House tightened controls, blocking TSMC and others from using U.S. technology to produce chips for Huawei.</p><p>Washington threw up new hurdles for Chinese chip designers in August by imposing restrictions on software known as EDA, or electronic design automation, along with European, Asian and other governments to limit the spread of “dual use” technologies that might be used to make weapons.</p><p>In December, Biden added YMTC, the memory chip maker, and some other Chinese companies to a blacklist that limits access to chips made anywhere using U.S. tools or processes.</p><p>China’s foundries can etch circuits as small as 28 nanometers apart. By contrast, TSMC and other global competitors can etch circuits just three nanometers apart, ten times the Chinese industry’s precision. They are moving toward two nanometers.</p><p>To make the latest chips, “you need EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) tools, a very complicated process recipe and not just a couple of billion dollars but tens and tens of billions of dollars,” said Peter Hanbury, who follows the industry for Bain &amp; Co.</p><p>“They’re not going to be able to produce competitive server, PC and smartphone chips,” Hanbury said. “You have to go to TSMC to do that.”</p><p>China's ruling party is trying to develop its own tool vendors, but researchers say it is far behind a global network spread across dozens of countries.</p><p>Huawei said in a video on its website in December it was working on EUV technology. But creating a machine comparable to ASML’s might cost $5 billion and require a decade of research, according to industry experts. Huawei didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The day when China can supply its own EUV machine is “very far away,” said Hanbury.</p><p>___</p><p>AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing and AP Writer Mike Corder in Amsterdam contributed.</p>]]></description>

Between the two cuts, that's about 3% of the world's oil supply. </p><p>Here are key things to know about the cutbacks: </p><h2>WHY ARE OIL PRODUCERS CUTTING BACK?</h2><p>Saudi Arabia, OPEC's dominant member, said Sunday that the move is “precautionary” to avoid a deeper slide in oil prices. </p><p>Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman has consistently taken a cautious approach to future demand and favored being proactive in adjusting supply ahead of a possible downturn in oil needs.</p><div id="afs:Card:863118820391" content-id="27e7b8785ff6fa3ca5df590d64cedb57" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-business) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>That stance seemed to be borne out as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-5f010ed0b66fb71e8d46040419a70203">oil prices fell from highs</a> of over $120 per barrel last summer to $73 last month. Prices jumped after Sunday's announcement, with international benchmark Brent <a href="https://apnews.com/03d9d1bfb51e2ce4a42bf7744bf1bafa">crude trading at about $85</a> on Monday, up 6%. </p><p>With fears of a U.S. recession exacerbated by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/banks-federal-reserve-silicon-valley-lending-rescue-a04875a164165b50e971ff4576bf4e27">bank collapses</a>, a lack of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-inflation-economic-growth-5fa7942504507e3ca708c8e4591ed8d8">European economic growth</a> and China’s rebound from COVID-19 taking longer than many expected, oil producers are wary of a sudden collapse in prices like during the pandemic and the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. </p><p>Capital markets analyst Mohammed Ali Yasin said most people had been waiting for the June 4 meeting of the OPEC+ alliance of OPEC members and allied producers, most prominently Russia. The decision underlined the urgency felt by producers. </p><p>“It was a surprise to all, I think, watchers and the market followers,” he said. “The swiftness of the move, the timing of the move and the size of the move were all significant.”</p><p>The aim now is to ward off "a continous slide of the oil price” to levels below $70 per barrel, which would be “very negative” for producer economies, Yasin said. </p><p>Part of the October cut of 2 millions barrels per day was on paper only as some OPEC+ countries aren’t able to produce their share. The new cut of 1.15 million barrels per day is distributed among countries that are hitting their quotas — so it amounts to roughly the same size cut as in October.</p><p>Governments announced the decision outside the usual OPEC+ framework. The Saudis are taking the lead with 500,000 barrels per day, with the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, Oman, Algeria and Kazakhstan contributing smaller cuts. </p><h2>WILL THE PRODUCTION CUT MAKE INFLATION WORSE?</h2><p>It certainly could. Analysts say supply and demand are relatively well balanced, which means production cuts could push prices higher in coming months. </p><p>The refineries that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russian-diesel-fuel-embargo-explainer-28b9043593c7cb92e032aa451c837b39">turn crude into gasoline, diesel and jet fuel</a> are getting ready for their summer production surge to meet the annual increase in travel demand. </p><p>In the U.S., gasoline prices are highly dependent on crude, which makes up about half of the price per gallon. Lower oil prices have meant U.S. drivers have seen the average price fall from records of over $5 per gallon in mid-2022 to $3.50 per gallon this week, according to motor club AAA. </p><div id="ca0f2dc842324f968c1aad75f134a940" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The cuts, if fully implemented, “would further tighten an already fundamentally tight oil market,” Jorge Leon, senior vice president at Rystad Energy, said in a research note. The cut could boost oil prices by around $10 per barrel and push international Brent to around $110 per barrel by this summer.</p><p>Those higher prices could fuel global inflation in a cycle that forces <a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-inflation-banks-interest-rates-jobs-91a9185ebce972bbf5ab1f46654f1a53">central banks to keep hiking interest rates</a>, which crimp economic growth, he said.</p><p>Given the fears about the overall economy, “the market may interpret the cuts as a vote of no confidence in the recovery of oil demand and could even carry a downside price risk — but that will only be for the very short term,” Leon said.</p><h2>WHAT WILL THIS MEAN FOR RUSSIA?</h2><p>Moscow says it will extend a cut of 500,000 barrels per day through the rest of the year. It needs oil revenue to support its economy and state budget hit by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/european-union-russia-government-moscow-europe-china-a855facf78132a8805c9ba52dd0fab60">wide-ranging sanctions</a> from the U.S., European Union and other allies of Ukraine. </p><p>Analysts think, however, that Russia's cut may simply be putting the best face on reduced demand for its oil. The West shunned Russian barrels even before sanctions were imposed, with Moscow managing to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-politics-business-china-middle-east-b6a90423ee7e2245e3eafc713083896f">reroute much of its oil to India, China</a> and Turkey. </p><p>But the Group of Seven major democracies imposed a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-moscow-europe-european-union-825506b6a349cce7e5971c0ac550aeaa">price cap of $60 per barrel</a> on Russian shipments, enforced by bans on Western companies that dominate shipping or insurance. Russia is selling oil at a discount, with revenue sagging at the start of this year. </p><h2>WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY?</h2><p>President Joe Biden addressed the OPEC+ cut on Monday before returning to the White House from a trip to Minnesota, predicting, “It’s not going to be as bad as you think.”</p><p>Earlier, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby expressed U.S. opposition to the move, saying, “We don’t think that production cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty, and we made that clear.”</p><p>But he insisted that the oil market is in a different place from last year when prices surged following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>“We’re focused on prices, we’re not focused on barrels,” he told reporters Monday, adding that the U.S. was given a heads-up before the announcement.</p><p>The White House response was milder than in October, when cuts came on the eve of U.S. midterm elections in which soaring gas prices were a major issue. Biden vowed at the time that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-business-saudi-arabia-middle-east-ea75287315c4e8a78014a4eccb114abe">there would be “consequences,”</a> and Democratic lawmakers called for freezing cooperation with the Saudis.</p><p>Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, said the cutback shows "the group's support for Russia and flies in the face of the Biden administration’s efforts to lower oil prices.” </p><p>___</p><p>AP journalists Bassam Hatoum in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Colleen Long in Minneapolis, and Zeke Miller and Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed.</p>]]></description>

Jeff Jackson of North Carolina has used it to explain the complex fight over raising the debt limit. Rep. Robert Garcia of California has used it to engage with members of the LGBTQ+ community. And Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania has used it to give an overview of Election Day results. </p><p>As <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-china-62ebef6be3c10e66d7f69f7f6d254700">pressure against TikTok mounts</a> in Washington, the more than two dozen members of Congress — all Democrats — who are active on the social media platform are being pushed by their colleagues to stop using it. Many defend their presence on the platform, saying they have a responsibility as public officials to meet Americans where they are — and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-congress-hearing-bytedance-china-biden-ceo-a92f048762d6657f291affb7a0ce6386">more than 150 million are on TikTok</a>.</p><p>“I’m sensitive to the ban and recognize some of the security implications. But there is no more robust and expeditious way to reach young people in the United States of America than TikTok,” Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota told The Associated Press. </p><p>Yet the lawmakers active on TikTok remain a distinct minority. Most in Congress are in favor of limiting the app, forcing a sale to remove connections to China or even banning it outright. The U.S. armed forces and more than half of U.S. states have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/why-is-tiktok-being-banned-7d2de01d3ac5ab2b8ec2239dc7f2b20d">already banned the app</a> from official devices, as has the federal government. Similar bans have been imposed in Denmark, Canada, Great Britain and New Zealand, as well as the European Union.</p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="14d60d562d2550cd483f4c7d8a8de5af">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Criticism of TikTok reached a new level last week as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-shou-zi-chew-testify-7927b1915db270aac67ca6f4ca31d6f3">CEO Shou Zi Chew testified</a> for more than six hours at a contentious hearing in the House. Lawmakers grilled Chew about the implications of the app for America's national security and the effect on the mental health of its users. And the tough questions came from both sides of the aisle, as Republicans and Democrats alike pressed Chew about TikTok’s content moderation practices, its ability to shield American data from Beijing and its spying on journalists.</p><p>“I've got to hand it to you," said Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, as members questioned Chew over data security and harmful content. “You’ve actually done something that in the last three to four years has not happened except for the exception of maybe (Russian President) Vladimir Putin. You have unified Republicans and Democrats.”</p><p>While the hearing made plain that lawmakers view TikTok as a threat, their lack of first-hand experience with the app was apparent at times. Some made inaccurate and head-scratching comments, seemingly not understanding how TikTok connects to a home Wi-Fi router or how it moderates illicit content. </p><p>Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., who is active on the app and opposes a nationwide ban, called the hearing “cringeworthy." </p><p>“It was just so painful to watch,” he told the AP on Friday. “And it just shows the real problem is Congress doesn’t have a lot of expertise, whether it be social media or, for that matter, more importantly, technology.”</p><p>Garcia, who said he uses TikTok more as a consumer, said most of his colleagues who are proposing a nationwide ban told him they had never used the app. “It gets hard to understand if you’re not actually on it,” the freshman Democrat said. “And at the end of the day, a lot of TikTok is harmless people dancing and funny videos.”</p><p>“It’s also incredibly rich educational content, and learning how to bake and learning about the political process,” he said. </p><p>Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., who has more than 180,000 followers on the app, held a news conference with TikTok influencers before the hearing. He accused Republicans of pushing a ban on TikTok for political reasons.</p><p>“There are 150 million people on TikTok and we are more connected to them than Republicans are,” Bowman said. “So for them, it’s all about fear-mongering and power. It’s not TikTok, because, again, we’ve looked the other way and allowed Facebook and other platforms to do similar things.” </p><p>Critics of TikTok in Congress say their opposition is rooted in national security, not politics. TikTok is a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-bytedance-china-biden-administration-14ef5f93dc2114e4ade110b2e85433fd">Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd.</a>, which appoints its executives. They worry Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over TikTok data on American users, effectively turning the app into a data-mining operation for a foreign power. The company insists it is taking steps to make sure that can never happen.</p><p>“The basic approach that we’re following is to make it physically impossible for any government, including the Chinese government, to get access to U.S. user data,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-china-biden-bytedance-data-misinformation-02b59e4a6611ce97c775da19de31d7ad">general counsel Erich Andersen</a> said during an interview with the AP on Friday at a cybersecurity conference in California.</p><p>TikTok has been emphasizing a $1.5 billion proposal to store all U.S. user data on servers owned and maintained by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-us-news-business-ap-top-news-hong-kong-4eab38c608901de16e92facc1ed5debd">the software giant Oracle</a>. Access to U.S. data would be managed by U.S. employees through a separate entity run independently of ByteDance and monitored by outside observers.</p><p>Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina took the unusual step of releasing a public statement urging all members of Congress to stop using TikTok, including from his home state — seemingly a jab at Jackson, who is one of the more active members with more than 1.8 million followers. </p><p>“I was just saying if we’re having a discussion about TikTok then I think we ought to at least reduce the pull factor by elected officials who can simply come off of it,” Tillis said this week, when asked about his statement. “I don’t have a TikTok account. So that was an easy separation for me.”</p><p>Loud warnings about TikTok have also been coming <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-united-states-government-ap-top-news-business-95491774cf8f0fe3e2b9634658a22e56">from President Joe Biden's administration</a>. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and FBI Director Christopher Wray have told Congress in recent weeks that TikTok is a national security threat. Blinken told lawmakers the threat “should be ended one way or another." </p><p>But some members are unconvinced. </p><p>“It’s like turning your cell phone off on an airplane. You’re supposed to do. And if it was super dangerous, I don’t think we will be allowed to have the phone on the plane,” Rep. Greg Landsman, D-Ohio, said Wednesday, “So if it was super dangerous for members of Congress to have this app on their phone, you have to imagine the administration or our government would say absolutely not, you can’t have it on a government phone.” </p><p>Concerns about what kind of content Americans encounter online, or how their data is collected by technology companies, also aren’t new. Congress has been wanting to curtail the amount of data tech companies collect on consumers through a national privacy law, but those efforts have stalled repeatedly over the years.</p><p>Supporters of TikTok on Capitol Hill are urging their colleagues to educate themselves about social media as a whole so Congress can pass legislation that deals with broader issues of data privacy, instead of hyper-focusing on a ban of TikTok, which could risk political backlash and a court fight over the reach of the First Amendment.</p><p>“We are uninformed and misinformed. We don’t even understand how social media works. We don’t know anything about data brokers and how data brokers sell our data to foreign countries and foreign companies right now,” Bowman said. “So ban TikTok tomorrow, this stuff is still going to be happening.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Haleluya Hadero in Sausalito, California, contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(Kyodo News via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi protested in a meeting Sunday with his Chinese counterpart the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-detained-japanese-national-3d5de6b45acc4083273cbb6e4aa29480">detention of a Japanese national in Beijing</a> and raised “strong concern" about China's escalating military activity near Taiwan and around Japan.</p><p>Hayashi is on a two-day visit to China, becoming Japan’s first diplomat to make the trip in more than three years as frictions grow between the countries. He also met Chinese Premier Li Qiang and top diplomat Wang Yi later Sunday.</p><p>During his talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, Hayashi demanded an early release of an employee of the Japanese pharmaceutical company Astellas Pharma, who was detained in Beijing last month over what the Chinese Foreign Ministry described as spying allegations. Neither side has offered further details about the man nor the allegations against him. </p><p>Hayashi told reporters he raised “serious concern” about China's increasingly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-japan-islands-taiwan-us-threats-61ff0bb8fdd5a7f26bd69475ff876b25">assertive activity in the East and South China seas,</a> and stressed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>He said he also expressed grave concern about Beijing’s increased joint military activity with Russia around Japan while Moscow wages war against Ukraine, and urged China to act responsibly for global peace. </p><div id="afs:Card:148376116072" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="c72360133caa475b0c3b110417e48b8e">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Hayashi said he told Qin while there is a possibility of improving cooperation in economic, cultural and people exchanges, the two countries also face “many problems and serious concerns" and that “Japan-China relations are currently at an extremely important phase.” </p><p>The two ministers agreed to work together in achieving “a constructive and stable relationship” as agreed between their leaders in November, Hayashi said. </p><p>The sides agreed to improve communication in regional security, and welcomed the establishment of a defense hotline last week and the resumption of defense talks, Hayashi said.</p><p>Hayashi said that he and Premier Li shared the importance of their bilateral economic ties, and that it was crucial that Japanese nationals and companies feel safe to operate in China.</p><p>That was the concern raised by representatives of Japanese companies during their meeting Saturday with Hayashi. They also sought transparent, predictable and fair business environment in China, said Yukiko Okano, deputy press secretary for the Japanese Foreign Ministry. </p><p>Separately, Hayashi told Wang that China's assertive activity in the East China Sea and the recent detention are “a stumbling block for promoting economic and people-to-people exchanges."</p><p>Despite close economic and business ties between the two Asian powers, Tokyo and Beijing have been increasingly at odds in recent years as Japan considers China’s growing influence in the region a threat to its security and economy. </p><p>Qin meanwhile warned against Japanese involvement in issues related to Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its own, saying Tokyo should not interfere and "undermine China's sovereignty in any way,” according to a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>Using strong language, Qin said “the Taiwan issue is at the core of China’s core interests and concerns the political foundation of China-Japan relations.”</p><p>Japan does not formally recognize Taiwan, but has strong unofficial ties with the island. It has been making statements of concern about regional stability in the Taiwan Strait and sent several prominent parliamentary delegations to Taipei. </p><p>Japan is increasingly worried about a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan because of its proximity to southwestern Japanese islands as well as disputed East China Sea islands, which are claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing, and has bolstered its defenses recent years. </p><p>The Japan coast guard said in a statement over the weekend that three Chinese coast guard ships had entered the Japanese-controlled waters around Senkaku Islands, which Beijing calls the Diaoyu. A Japanese patrol ship repeatedly demanded they leave while protecting two Japanese fishing boats, the coast guard said. </p><p>Qin criticized Japan over its new <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-semiconductor-trade-violations-e0564c045bdc33a0c5fe0c4cc795db8b">export controls of semi-conductor manufacturing equipment</a> that require companies to get government permission. The U.S. has imposed similar measures and Japan had acknowledged consulting with Washington on its own regulation. </p><p>“The U.S. once used bullying tactics to brutally suppress Japan’s semiconductor industry, and now it is repeating the same old tricks against China,” Qin said, urging Japan not to be America's pawn. “One should not do unto others what one would not have done unto oneself.”</p><p>Hayashi said the measure is not targeting any specific country. But it was seen as part of a U.S.-led agreement to make sure advanced semi-conductor manufacturing stays out of the reach of the Chinese industry.</p><p>The last Japanese foreign minister to visit China was Hayashi's predecessor, Toshimitsu Motegi, in 2019, just before China imposed rigorous pandemic border controls and other measures. </p><p>___</p><p>Wu reported from Taipei, Taiwan. </p><p>___</p><p>Find more of AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific">https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Noah Berger)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>SAULSALITO, Calif. (AP) — Under intense scrutiny from Washington that could lead to a potential ban, the top attorney for TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance defended the social media platform’s plan to safeguard U.S. user data from China.</p><p>“The basic approach that we’re following is to make it physically impossible for any government, including the Chinese government, to get access to U.S. user data," said general counsel Erich Andersen during a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press at a cybersecurity conference in Sausalito, California, on Friday sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation and Aspen Digital and featuring top government officials, tech executives and journalists. </p><p>ByteDance will continue to develop its new app called Lemon8, Andersen said. </p><p>“We’re obviously going to do our best with the Lemon8 app to comply with U.S. law and to make sure we do the right thing here," Andersen said, referring to the new social app developed by ByteDance that resembles Instagram and Pinterest. “But I think we got a long way to go with that application — it's pretty much a startup phase.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>ByteDance’s most known app, TikTok, is under intense scrutiny over concerns it could hand over user data to the Chinese government or push pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation on its behalf. Lemon8 was introduced across app stores in Japan in April 2020 and has been rolled out in more countries since then. It's available for download in the U.S. and could face similar scrutiny to TikTok. </p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="02b59e4a6611ce97c775da19de31d7ad">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Leaders at the FBI, CIA and officials at other government agencies have warned that ByteDance could be forced to give user data — such as browsing history, IP addresses and biometric identifiers — to Beijing under a 2017 law that compels companies to cooperate with the government for matters involving China’s national security. Another Chinese law, implemented in 2014, has similar mandates. </p><p>To assuage concerns from U.S. officials, TikTok has been emphasizing a $1.5 billion proposal, called Project Texas, to store all U.S. user data on servers owned and maintained by the software giant Oracle. Under the plan, access to U.S. data would be managed by U.S. employees through a separate entity called TikTok U.S. Data Security, which is run independently of ByteDance and monitored by outside observers.</p><p>Some lawmakers have said that’s not enough. But despite skepticism about the project, TikTok says it is moving forward anyway.</p><p>“We’re investing in a system where people don’t have to believe the Chinese government and they don’t have to believe us,” Andersen said.</p><p>He also wondered if the skepticism was being driven by something else.</p><p>“Where are we falling short here?” he said. “At some point you get beyond the cybersecurity risk assessment, etcetera, and you get to ‘We don’t like your nationality.’”</p><p>TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has said the company started deleting all historic U.S. user data from non-Oracle servers this month and expects that process to be completed this year. During a congressional hearing held last week, Chew said migrating the data to Oracle will keep it out of China’s hands, but also acknowledged China-based employees may still have access to it before the process wraps up.</p><p>TikTok maintains it has never been requested to turn over any kind of data and won’t do so if asked. But whether those promises, or Project Texas, will allow it to stay operating in the U.S. remains to be seen. </p><p>The U.S., as well as Britain, the European Union and others, have banned TikTok on government devices. And the Biden administration is reportedly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-china-cfius-national-security-a7f59032a6a68c67470a0746d560e411">threatening a U.S. ban</a> on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stakes in the company. </p><p>On Friday, Andersen said a ban would be "basically giving up".</p><p>“Banning a platform like TikTok is a defeat, it’s a statement that we aren’t creative enough to find another way,” he said. </p><p>China has said it would oppose a possible sale, a declaration that makes it more difficult for TikTok to position itself and ByteDance as a global enterprise instead of a Chinese company. In 2020, the country had also come out in fierce opposition to executive orders by then President Donald Trump that sought to ban TikTok and the messaging app WeChat. </p><p>"They were clear about their point of view back in 2020 timeframe when we faced an existential challenge from executive orders under the Trump administration,” Andersen said.</p><p>Courts blocked Trump’s efforts, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders after taking office. The company has since been in talks about privacy concerns with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multi-agency panel that sits under the Treasury department. </p><p>Meanwhile, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been pushing bills that would effectively ban TikTok or give the administration more authority to do so. One bill by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley was blocked this week by Sen. Rand Paul, the only Republican who has come out in opposition to a TikTok ban. A small number of progressive lawmakers have also said they would oppose a ban, and argued the U.S. should implement a national privacy law to curtail the problem. </p><p>Andersen said Friday TikTok would support broad-based privacy legislation.</p><p>"Our view is that we would really welcome broad-based legislation that applies broadly and evenly,” he said. “What we don’t like, frankly, is legislation that is sort of targeted at one company.”</p><p>TikTok could also be banned through another bill, called the RESTRICT Act, that has garnered broad bipartisan support in the Senate and backing from the White House. The legislation does not call out TikTok but would give the Commerce Department power to review and potentially restrict foreign threats to technology platforms. </p><p>___</p><p>This story has been updated to change Hewlett-Packard Foundation to Hewlett Foundation.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Under pressure from the U.S. government, TikTok is now facing the music with the possibility of a nationwide ban if it defies a government order to sell to an American company — unless the popular social media app can convince a high-powered panel that its data security restructuring plan sufficiently guards against national security concerns. </p><p>At the heart of this social media business and national security drama is the increasingly tense relations between the U.S. and China.</p><p>The video-sharing platform with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-congress-hearing-bytedance-china-biden-ceo-a92f048762d6657f291affb7a0ce6386">150 million U.S. users</a> is best known for quick snippets of viral dance routines and has been under scrutiny for years by federal authorities who say that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could share sensitive user data with the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf.</p><p>Having already banned the shipment of certain technologies to China, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/why-is-tiktok-being-banned-7d2de01d3ac5ab2b8ec2239dc7f2b20d">recently passing new legislation banning the app on government devices</a>, lawmakers want to pursue a nationwide ban on the app if the tech firm can’t be sold to an American buyer.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Enter: The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The little-known but potentially potent government agency known as CFIUS is tasked with investigating corporate deals for national security concerns and holds power to force the company to change.</p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="a7f59032a6a68c67470a0746d560e411">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>WHY IS CFIUS SCRUTINIZING TIKTOK?</p><p>For at least two years, the U.S. government has tried to force TikTok ownership to divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, though CFIUS’ review of the social media app goes back at least to 2019.</p><p>Former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin confirmed in 2020 that CFIUS was reviewing whether then-President Donald Trump could ban TikTok in the U.S. Its members agreed that TikTok cannot operate in the U.S. in its current form because it “risks sending back information on 100 million Americans,” Mnuchin said at the time. </p><p>As geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. have soared in recent months, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-shou-zi-chew-testify-7927b1915db270aac67ca6f4ca31d6f3">TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew</a> testified last week before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew-security-risk-cc36f36801d84fc0652112fa461ef140">grilled about online safety</a> and user privacy in a hostile hearing that did little to ease lawmakers’ concerns. Chew was repeatedly questioned about the Chinese Communist Party’s influence on ByteDance but deflected.</p><p>“TikTok is not available in mainland China, and today we’re headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore, but I’m not saying that the founders of ByteDance are not Chinese, nor am I saying that we don’t make use of Chinese employees, just like many other companies around the world,” he added. “We do use their expertise on some engineering projects.”</p><p>WHAT IS CFIUS? </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/yellen-banking-federal-reserve-silicon-valley-bank-dfd110d0b55d3284afaafc4677616b9e">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen</a> oversees CFIUS, a committee made up of members from the State, Justice, Energy and Commerce Departments among others, which investigates national security risks from foreign investments in American firms. </p><p>The committee screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security. The committee’s powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA. In September, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals – such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or risks to Americans’ sensitive personal data.</p><p>SELL, BAN OR ORACLE?</p><p>Defying CFIUS’ orders to sell ultimately could mean doing business with the company may violate the law. That would suck the life out of its business operations, such as banking, payroll, advertising, and app store services.</p><p>But the company said it’s already mitigating national security concerns with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-shou-zi-chew-8d8a6a9694357040d484670b7f4833be">$1.5 billion mitigation plan called Project Texas</a> that would route all U.S. user data to servers owned and maintained by the U.S. software giant Oracle. </p><p>“When that process is complete, all protected U.S. data will be under the protection of U.S. law and under the control of the U.S.-led security team. Under this structure, there is no way for the Chinese government to access it or compel access to it,” Chew said.</p><p>While CFIUS can adopt such mitigation agreements, it’s not clear if the committee will accept TikTok’s proposed alternative, said Anupam Chander, a Georgetown University technology law professor. If CFIUS rejects TikTok’s preferred solution, Chander said the federal agency should have an obligation to explain how it finds that plan to be insufficient given that it amounts to an enormous restructuring of the company.</p><p>“TikTok proposes lots of well-paid, third-party auditors that would be doing this kind of routine monitoring,” Chander said. “This is an expensive proposition for TikTok but by no means would I treat this as window dressing.”</p><p>Though Chew last week also insisted that the company was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tiktok-security-technology-social-media-2245e433b5854010ebd99b7987fc78ca">not interested in a sale</a>, TikTok has considered it before. TikTok had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-air-force-technology-media-social-media-37b7a05819501e2bb5c352e7efd4d54f">advanced negotiations with Microsoft</a> after the company was put against the wall by the Trump administration in 2020, facing either an outright ban and CFIUS’ divestment order. Microsoft said TikTok ultimately rejected their offer, and though TikTok later said it would sell to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-entertainment-technology-4e25c45894479d77fb4949b64673d92b">Oracle and Walmart</a>, it doesn’t appear that Project Texas amounts to a sale, Chander said.</p><p>Should TikTok agree to a sale in the future, not only would CFIUS have to approve that transaction, but the Chinese government – which has said it won’t support forced divestment – could also intervene.</p><p>WHAT'S NEXT?</p><p>Leaders in the U.S., European Union, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Taiwan <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-privacy-cybersecurity-bytedance-china-2dce297f0aed056efe53309bbcd44a04">have also banned TikTok</a> on government-issued devices and at least two countries have banned TikTok outright. </p><p>Afghanistan’s Taliban leadership last year banned it on the grounds of protecting young people from “being misled,” while India imposed a nationwide ban on TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in 2020 over privacy and security concerns. The ban came shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border killed 20 Indian soldiers and injured dozens.</p><p>Historically, CFIUS has focused on things like shipping and manufacturing when reviewing transactions for national security concerns, but it signaled deeper interest in popular social media when it ordered the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew-security-risk-cc36f36801d84fc0652112fa461ef140">dating app Grindr to divest</a> in 2019, Chander said.</p><p>The function of CFIUS was also in the spotlight last year after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-deal-live-updates-78d68790fb0b9971d6e65b76d97e3670">billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter</a>, plunging the microblogging platform into chaos. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-technology-social-media-misinformation-fd4227b138878a5b0e5129a4bdd5bac0">Yellen waffled</a> on whether or not CFIUS would or could review that sale, given Musk’s investments in China as well as significant Saudi interest. </p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Shuji Kajiyama, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese Cabinet minister in charge of tackling the country's declining birthrate unveiled a draft proposal Friday aimed at reversing the downtrend, including increased subsidies for childrearing and education and a salary increase for younger workers to incentivize marrying and having kids.</p><p>Japan’s population of more than 125 million has been declining for 15 years and is projected to fall to 86.7 million by 2060. A shrinking and aging population has huge implications for the economy and for national security as the country <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-japan-8d8fe00c6e87914f1dd1ea3388a7f6db">fortifies its military to counter China’s increasingly assertive territorial ambitions</a>.</p><p>Children's Policies Minister Masanobu Ogura said the next few years are possibly "a last chance” for Japan to reverse its declining births. If the number of births keeps falling at the rate since the beginning of 2000, the young population will shrink at twice the current pace in the 2030s, he said.</p><p>Many younger Japanese have balked at marrying or having families, discouraged by bleak job prospects, corporate cultures incompatible with having both parents — but especially women — work, and the lack of public tolerance for small children.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>To address the problems, Ogura’s plan proposes increased financial assistance, including more government subsidies for childrearing, more generous student loans for higher education and greater access to childcare services. It also aims to change the cultural mindset toward more gender equality both at work and at home. The proposal also includes increased government assistance to companies to encourage more of male staff to take paternity leave, which has been a point of contention for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-politics-sports-japan-3e985bedf6f1ce4ad5cb92a1411c2ad6">working fathers fearing retaliation</a>.</p><div id="afs:Card:502069099909" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="fd5c77386b0f85e9f4d993265070781b">Hub peek embed (China) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“While diverse views about marriage, childbirth and childrearing should be respected, we want to make a society where young generations can marry, have and raise children as they wish,” Ogura said. “The basic direction of our measures to tackle low births is to reverse the trend of declining births by supporting individuals’ pursuit of happiness.”</p><p>He said he submitted the proposal to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for further consideration. It will be part of a bigger policy package that Kishida’s government will compile in June. </p><p>In 2022, Japan had 799,728 newborns, a record low, falling below 800,000 for the first time since surveys began in 1899. Many couples are hesitating to add to their families because of rising costs.</p><p>Japan is the world’s third biggest economy but living costs are high, wage increases have been slow and about 40% of Japanese are part-time or contract workers. Critics say the government has lagged in making society more inclusive for children, women and minorities.</p><p>Under the conservative governing party, which supports traditional family values and gender roles, women who are unmarried or without children tend to be less respected, and marriage is a prerequisite for having children.</p><p>Ogura's proposal did not mention its estimated cost.</p><p>So far, government efforts to encourage people to have more babies have had a limited impact despite subsidies for pregnancies, births and childcare.</p><p>In a country that ranks among the worst globally in gender equality, the situation hampers women's pursuit of careers after marriage or after having children. </p><p>The majority of Japanese between the ages of 18 and 34 say they hope to marry at some point but plan to have fewer than two children. A growing percentage say they have no intention of getting married, according to data cited in the proposal.</p>]]></description>

Huawei reported a higher-than-usual 113.7 billion yuan ($16.6 billion) in profit in 2021 due to the sale of Honor, its budget smartphone business. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“The year 2022 is a year where Huawei pulled ourselves out of a crisis mode. U.S. restrictions are now our new normal and we’re back to business as usual,” said Sabrina Meng, Huawei’s chief financial officer. </p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="d786d6cf7cc3aabd01bdb545323eb7b4">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Also known as Meng Wanzhou, she is the daughter of Huawei’s founder and will become its rotating chairwoman from April 1, a role that allows her to oversee Huawei's businesses for six months. </p><p>Meng was detained in Canada for nearly three years after her arrest on U.S. charges of lying to Hong Kong banks about dealings with Iran in violation of trade sanctions. She was released under a deal with the U.S. Justice Department that dismissed the charges in exchange for her accepting responsibility for misrepresenting Huawei’s dealings with Iran.</p><p>Huawei, one of China’s first global tech brands, has been caught up in China-U.S. tensions over technology and security. American officials say the company is a security risk and might enable Chinese spying, an accusation Huawei denies.</p><p>The U.S. has banned U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei, cutting off its access to chips and software such as Google services for its smartphones and preventing it from selling its telecommunications gear to U.S. customers.</p><p>The Shenzhen-headquartered telecommunications company shifted its focus in 2022 to growing its corporate business by selling network equipment and services to industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, transportation and mining to help them become more digital.</p><p>For now, those efforts seem to have paid off. Huawei’s enterprise business revenues in 2022 grew 30% from a year earlier to 133.2 billion yuan ($19.4 billion). Its growth in 2021 was just 2.1%.</p><p>Revenue from its company’s consumer business, which sells smartphones, tablets and other devices, continued to decline, falling 11.9%. Huawei was the world’s largest smartphone maker in 2020 but has since seen its global market share plunge after losing its Android license and Google services.</p><p>Huawei is one of the world's biggest spenders on research and development, devoting a record 161.5 billion yuan ($23.5 billion) in 2022, representing 25% of its total revenue. </p><p>Just over half of Huawei's workforce of 207,000 employees work in R&amp;D. The company's R&amp;D efforts have helped it replace components that it lost access to when Huawei was hit by U.S. sanctions, Meng said.</p><p>Rotating chairman Xu said Friday that Huawei had achieved breakthroughs in electronic design automation tools for chips at 14 nanometers and above together with its partners, and that the breakthrough would allow it to use the tools for its chip design efforts.</p><p>The breakthrough comes as the Chinese government is pushing for self-reliance in technology as tensions with the U.S. rise.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BANGKOK (AP) — Developing economies in Asia have mostly regained ground lost during the pandemic but are seeing their recoveries stall as productivity lags, the World Bank said in a report released Friday.</p><p>The report forecasts that growth in the region including China will pick up pace this year after the world's No. 2 economy <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-social-media-business-0541b707cbac22cf3b3d4b545ff34ff5">relaxed pandemic restrictions</a> on travel and other activities. But recoveries elsewhere in the region, excluding China, will moderate as pressures of inflation and growing household debt slow consumer spending, it said. </p><p>Across the Asia-Pacific, economies are expected to grow at a 5.1% annual pace this year, up from 3.5% in 2022, the report said. But not including China, growth is expected to slip to 4.9% in 2023 after a rebound from the worst of the pandemic of 5.8% in 2022, it said. </p><p>Major Asian economies like Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-economy-asia-slowdown-8090b98f41769710850d76a7b86c1aac">Vietnam</a> will see their recoveries slow and meanwhile face risks from weakening global growth, spillover from the war in Ukraine and climate change disasters. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Demand for exports from the region has slowed as the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-inflation-banks-interest-rates-jobs-91a9185ebce972bbf5ab1f46654f1a53">Federal Reserve</a> and other central banks have targeted inflation by hiking interest rates, making it more costly to buy on credit or get mortgages. </p><div id="afs:Card:863118820391" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="2ca6355b3350e13639d1530ebbb438a5">Hub peek embed (apf-business) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-politics-economy-congress-xi-jinping-3fca614a0767b788ad42e4d2c73607d6">China's economy</a> has slowed significantly in the longer term, even as it <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-li-qiang-boao-5b9416a240ca9497162b753fba910a6d">bounces back</a> from the disruptions caused by the pandemic. </p><p>Friction between the U.S. and China over trade and technology are “the most immediate challenge” for the region, the report said. </p><p>Sanctions and other restrictions imposed by each side have to a certain extent diverted trade to other countries. While China lost market share in exports to the U.S. in recent years, countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia have gained share. But geopolitics can disrupt trade and limit sharing of knowhow while also preventing other countries from attaining the scale of operations to serve global markets, the report said. </p><p>Private economists have also cut their forecasts for growth in the region this year, citing the possibility that the tighter monetary policies may bring on recessions in the U.S. or other major economies. Many countries in the region are grappling with onerous debt loads after spending heavily during the pandemic, while households also borrowed heavily. </p><p>“Once pent-up demand from post-lockdown fades, we think that Asian economies will settle at lower GDP growth and higher inflation than our pre-pandemic forecasts,” Sung Eun Jung of Oxford Economics said in a report. </p><p>The region has made huge strides in alleviating poverty but progress toward higher incomes and reducing inequality has stalled due to a slowing of reforms and productivity gains, the World Bank report said. But countries need to address longstanding needs for reform such as investing more in education and public health to improve productivity and spur sustainable growth.</p><p>“Most major economies of East Asia and the Pacific have come through the difficulties of the pandemic but must now navigate a changed global landscape,” World Bank East Asia and Pacific Vice President Manuela V. Ferro said in a statement. “To regain momentum, there is work left to do to boost innovation, productivity, and to set the foundations for a greener recovery.”</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — More than 60 self-exiled members of a Chinese Christian church who were detained in Thailand paid fines for overstaying their visas but remained in police custody Saturday uncertain about their legal status amid fears they would be deported against their will to their home country, where they face possible persecution.</p><p>The 63 members of the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church were taken to court Friday in the resort city of Pattaya after being detained a day earlier by Thai immigration authorities. The 32 members of the group considered to be adults were charged with overstaying their visas, said Col. Tawee Kutthalaeng, chief of the Pattaya-area Nong Prue police station. Two American citizens who were with the group and briefly held had not been placed under arrest, he said.</p><p>After being fined, the church members had expected to be released to be able to return to where they had been staying in the area, said Deana Brown, one of two American supporters who accompanied them. Brown said she has been working to resettle the church members in Tyler, Texas, where her organization is based.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>However, they were put on two buses which first took them to the Pattaya office of the immigration police and then drove them to Bangkok for what a police officer told The Associated Press was normal processing of their case.</p><div id="afs:Card:148376116072" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="798a4462bf5dbcc54d523b7430632b40">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The drive under police escort from Pattaya to Bangkok, which would normally take about two hours, instead took closer to five because the passengers forced the buses to stop en route and disembarked by the roadside, saying they feared they were being driven to Bangkok's international airport to be repatriated. </p><p>There were grounds for their skepticism. In 2015, Thailand sent 109 members of the Muslim Uyghur minority back to China against their will despite fears they would face official persecution and possible torture. The U.N. refugee agency at the time called Thailand’s action “a flagrant violation of international law,” and the United States also condemned the deportations.</p><p>Only after receiving reassurances by phone did the Chinese church members continue their journey, arriving early Saturday morning at a police facility known as the Police Club in northern Bangkok that has space for large numbers of detainees. The main Immigration Detention Center in the middle of Bangkok, where some detainees have been stuck for years, is notoriously overcrowded.</p><p>Members of the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church, also called the Mayflower Church, came to Thailand in 2022 seeking asylum. They are trying to get to the U.S., but the current status of their applications is not clear. Most members of the church are young, married, middle-class couples, with their children making up about half the group.</p><p>They fled China in 2019 alleging that they were being persecuted by government security forces, initially settling on South Korea’s Jeju Island. They left South Korea for Thailand after meetings with local and U.S. officials made it clear that prospects for refuge there were dim.</p><p>Human Rights Watch issued a statement Saturday appealing to the Thai government not to repatriate the group.</p><p>“Thai authorities need to recognize the grave dangers facing Christians back in China and under no circumstances force them to return,” said Elaine Pearson, the New York-based organization's Asia director. </p><p>"If Thailand determines that the 63 Christian Chinese cannot stay, then they should be permitted to seek protection in another country,” Pearson said. “Rights-respecting governments should urgently step up to express their willingness to receive these asylum seekers at risk.”</p><p>Brown, CEO of the Texas-based Freedom Seekers International, an organization whose mission statement says it seeks to rescue “the most severely persecuted Christians in hostile and restrictive countries,” said that when the group looked into renewing their visas, they were told of a new requirement that any Chinese citizen renewing a visa in Thailand must report to the Chinese Embassy first. Their visas expired several months ago.</p><p>“When they told us that, we knew that nobody could get their visas,” Brown said. “There was no way, because as soon as they walk into the Chinese Embassy they’re gone, we would not see them again. They’ve been hiding out since then.”</p><p>The press section at the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok did not answer its telephone and the embassy did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.</p><p>The U.S. Embassy said it had no immediate comment on the case.</p><p>Upon their 2022 arrival in Thailand, church members told reporters that they had been stalked, harassed and received threatening calls and messages even while they were in South Korea. They said relatives in China had been summoned, interrogated and intimidated.</p><p>At that time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the matter was “not a diplomatic question” and declined to comment further.</p><p>In China, Christians are legally allowed to worship only in churches affiliated with Communist Party-controlled religious groups, but for decades the authorities largely tolerated independent, unregistered “house churches.” They have tens of millions of worshippers, possibly outnumbering those in the official groups.</p><p>In recent years, however, house churches have come under heavy pressure, with many prominent ones shut down. Unlike previous crackdowns, such as Beijing’s ban on Falun Gong, a spiritual movement it labels a cult, the authorities have also targeted some believers not explicitly opposed to the Chinese state.</p><p>China is one of 15 nations that the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom in its annual report last year recommended be designated as “countries of particular concern” for repression of religious groups.</p><p>It said the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s policies require religious groups to support its rule and its political objectives, including by altering their religious teachings to conform to the party’s ideology and policy. “Both registered and unregistered religious groups and individuals who run afoul of the CCP face harassment, detention, arrest, imprisonment, and other abuses,” the commission said.</p><p>___</p><p>Rising reported from Bangkok. Associated Press journalist Dake Kang in Bo’ao, China, contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

He said the decision was made “to fulfill Japan's global responsibility as a country possessing advanced chip technology” and not to target China or follow the U.S. move. Japan consulted with the United States, the Netherlands and other like-minded countries, Nishimura said. </p><p>An addition point of friction between the two sides is China's detention of an employee of the Japanese pharmaceutical company Astellas Pharma earlier this month on suspicion of spying. Japan's government has demanded his release and an explanation.</p><p>China's Foreign Ministry said the Japanese citizen is suspected of “engaging in espionage activities in violation of the criminal law ... and the Anti-Espionage Law of the People’s Republic of China."</p><p>Mao offered no new information about the case but said the detainee's legal rights would be protected and that he would have access to Japanese consular officials.</p><p>More than a dozen Japanese citizens with business or other connections to China have been arrested in the past over allegations including spying.</p><p>A long-festering dispute over uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan but claimed by China also flared again in mid-March, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-japan-islands-taiwan-us-threats-61ff0bb8fdd5a7f26bd69475ff876b25">with both sides accusing the other of infringing on their maritime territory.</a></p><p>The islands are known as the Senkakus in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. Taiwan also claims the islands but has forged agreements with Japan to avoid such conflicts. </p><p>China routinely sends coast guard vessels and planes into waters and airspace surrounding the islands to harass Japanese vessels in the area and force Japan to scramble jets in response.</p><p>Japan considers China a threat to its national and regional security and has been expanding its security cooperation with other “like-minded” countries in the region and Europe, as well as with NATO, while promoting a vision of a “free and open Indo-Pacific" as a counter to China.</p><p>Hayashi said Friday he will travel to Brussels after his China visit to attend a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting to reaffirm Japan's commitment to the rules-based international order and reinforce cooperation between Japan and NATO in their response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other key issues. </p><p>Japan is also concerned about growing joint military exercises between China and Russia around Japan's coasts.</p><p>Also Friday, China's Defense Ministry said it was setting up a direct telephone connection with its Japanese counterpart to “strengthen the capabilities of the two sides to manage and control maritime and air crises.”</p><p>The Chinese ministry has a similar hotline with the Pentagon. However, after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-china-antony-blinken-51e49202f2a0a50541cde059934c4cfb">the U.S. shooting down of a suspected Chinese spy balloon in February,</a> China refused to accept a phone call from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to discuss the matter, threatening unspecified retaliation instead.</p><p>___</p><p>AP videojournalist Haruka Nuga contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Salim Dawood)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — When Vice President Kamala Harris arrived in Zambia on Friday for the final stop of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-africa-ghana-tanzania-zambia-739eefcd5790e60c7f3a09ff1b9fdfa6">her weeklong trip across Africa</a>, she touched down at an airport that’s doubled in size and features glittering new terminals.</p><p>Rather than a symbol of promising local development, it’s a reminder of China’s deep influence. Beijing financed the project, one of many that has expanded its footprint on a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-ghana-africa-economy-cd35572b7b1e8ca7e696f0c4bedaece9">booming continent</a> that's rich in natural resources, often generating goodwill among its citizens. </p><p>The global rivalry between the United States and China has been a recurring backdrop for Harris’ journey, and nowhere has that been more apparent than Zambia and her previous stop in Tanzania. </p><p>Besides the airport, China built a 60,000-seat stadium in Lusaka, plus roads and bridges around the country. Zambia is on the hook for all of the development with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-government-united-states-janet-yellen-kenneth-kaunda-africa-63f4a0098fc3b2d14016e0f388b0ae6c">billions of dollars in debt</a>. Tanzania is a major trading partner with China, and it has a new political leadership school funded by the Chinese Communist Party.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The developments <a href="https://apnews.com/article/g-20-summit-politics-covid-china-government-united-states-46a01f4190fae4ca260f0ab5beaa59a5">have alarmed Washington</a>, and President Joe Biden’s administration is worried that Africa is slipping further into Beijing’s sphere of influence. </p><p>Harris has played down the issue on her trip, preferring to focus on building partnerships independent of geopolitical competition. However, she has acknowledged there’s limited time for the U.S. to make inroads on the continent, telling reporters earlier in the trip that there is a “window” that is “definitely open now” for American investments. </p><div id="afs:Card:148376116072" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="a17d6d9a4c409d79e429d2a6494fe23c">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>At a news conference with Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema on Friday, Harris reiterated her call for “all bilateral official creditors to provide a meaningful debt reduction for Zambia” — an oblique reference to China — but she stressed that “our presence here is not about China.”</p><p>Hichilema said it would be “completely wrong” to view Zambia’s interests in terms of a rivalry between the U.S. and China.</p><p>“When I’m in Washington, I’m not against Beijing. When I’m in Beijing, I’m not against Washington,” he said, adding that “none of these relationships are about working against someone or a group of countries."</p><p>China’s roots in both Tanzania and Zambia run deep. In the 1970s, Beijing built the Tazara Railway from landlocked Zambia to Tanzania’s Dar es Salaam port, allowing copper exports to circumvent white-minority-ruled Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa.</p><p>Today, China is Africa’s largest two-way trading partner, with $254 billion of business in 2021, according to <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/12/10-things-know-about-us-china-rivalry-africa">the United States Institute of Peace</a>. That’s four times the amount of trade between the U.S. and Africa. In addition, dealing with Beijing features <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-africa-tanzania-zambia-democracy-307a93c5eca40aa5f40cecacb8b22c5e">less admonishments about democracy</a> than with Washington. </p><p>“Most African countries are rightly unapologetic about their close ties to China,” Nigeria’s vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, tweeted on Thursday. “China shows up where and when the West will not and/or are reluctant.”</p><p>Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who has worked on Africa issues in Congress, expressed frustration over China’s growing influence on the continent. </p><p>“We switched from being the No. 1 trade partner or the No. 1 investment partner in two dozen countries, to China being the No. 1 trade and investment partner,” he told reporters aboard Air Force Two on the flight to Ghana at the beginning of Harris’ trip. “I think our challenge for this decade is to address that.”</p><p>Biden has been taking steps toward that, such as hosting a summit for African leaders in December, when he announced that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-g-20-summit-politics-africa-china-04ce188209d1fac0c4f9e946825e3c2f">he wants to commit $55 billion</a> to the continent in the coming years. </p><p>Harris has made announcements as well during her trip, including more than $1 billion in public and private money for economic development, $100 million for security assistance in West Africa and $500 million to facilitate trade with Tanzania. </p><p>However, there’s skepticism about whether the U.S. will follow through on its promises, and Harris has been faced with not-so-subtle hints that Africa expects more. For example, the presidents of Ghana and Tanzania bluntly said they hope Biden chooses to visit their countries during his expected trip to Africa later this year, which would be his first to the continent as president.</p><p>By comparison, Tanzania was among the first countries that Chinese President Xi Jinping visited after becoming president in 2013. And after Xi secured a third term, Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan was the first African head of state to visit Beijing.</p><p>“Kamala faces Chinese dominance in Tanzania,” the Tanzania Business Insight publication tweeted Wednesday.</p><p>Ian Johnson, a former China-based journalist who works at the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations, said Beijing presents a powerful narrative in the developing world as a country that rapidly built its economy and pulled much of its population out of poverty. </p><p>African leaders think “let’s see what we can learn from China,” he said, adding that “there’s a certain fascination in how they did it.”</p><p>Johnson also said China views Africa differently than the U.S. </p><p>“We have a tendency to see Africa as a series of problems — wars, famines, something like that,” he said. "But in China’s eyes, Africa is much more of an opportunity.”</p><p>Edem Selormey, who conducts public opinion research at the Ghana Center for Democratic Development, said the feeling is often mutual. </p><p>“China’s influence in Africa is largely seen as positive,” she said. “And the U.S. trails China in that regard.”</p><p>The difference, she said, is often about “what citizens see on the ground,” such as infrastructure projects, and “the U.S. has been missing from this picture for a while.”</p><p>John Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, said the debt that comes from China’s involvement is ultimately corrosive. He said African leaders are “beginning to realize that China is not really their friend.”</p><p>“China’s interests in the region are purely selfish, as opposed to the United States,” he said.</p><p>It’s a sentiment that draws scoffs in some corners of Africa.</p><p>“America is like playing the role of a big Uncle Sam in trying to defend African countries against what they think is the encroachment of China into the liberty of African countries through these loans,” said Tanzania-based analyst Mohamed Issa Hemed.</p><p>However, he added, “China is ahead of the U.S. in many, many ways."</p><p>Daniel Russel, a former State Department official who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute, summed up the African perspective as “enough with the lectures” about China. “They’ve got something we want. And they’ve got it right here.”</p><p>When it comes to U.S. hopes for Africa, he said, ”you can’t beat something with nothing.”</p><p>___ Anna reported from Nairobi, Kenya, and Meldrum from Johannesburg.

(AP Photo/Moises Castillo)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>MEXICO CITY (AP) — As Taiwan’s diplomatic partners dwindle and turn instead to rival China, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is aiming to shore up ties with the self-governing island’s remaining allies during a trip this week to Central America. </p><p>Tsai touched down in Guatemala on Friday afternoon, walking from the plane along a red carpet alongside Guatemala's foreign minister.</p><p>In a speech addressed to leaders of Guatemala and Belize shortly before departing on her visit, Tsai framed the trip as a chance to show Taiwan’s commitment to democratic values globally. </p><p>“External pressure will not obstruct our resolution to go on the world stage. We will be calm, self-confident, we will not submit but also not provoke,” said Tsai, who will also meet with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in a stopover in the United States.</p><p>But the trip also is aimed to solidifying ties in Latin America as China funnels money into the region and pressures its countries to break off relations with the self-governed democratic island.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>In Guatemala and Belize, Tsai is expected to bring an open checkbook. But in a region under growing Chinese influence, analysts say that Taiwan may already have lost the long game. </p><div id="afs:Card:344160070650" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="bbcbd2dd230f1a71e3128873024411b6">Hub peek embed (Taiwan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“These countries, they are symbolic. And I don’t think Taiwan wants to lose any of them,” said June Teufel Dreyer, a political scientist at University of Miami. “But if China is going to indulge in checkbook diplomacy, I don’t think Taiwan can compete and it knows it.”</p><p>The visit comes just days after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-biden-united-states-geopolitics-honduras-investment-taiwan-1bf1173f167b779e209a43f9cb4bfd7a">Honduras became the latest country</a> to break with Taiwan in favor of establishing ties with China.</p><p>Honduras follows in the footsteps of Nicaragua, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Panama and Costa Rica in ditching Taiwan. In some cases, China was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-dominicanrepublic-taiwan-idUSKBN1I22LN">said to have dangled</a> hefty investment packages and loans in exchange for switching allegiances.</p><p>As the Asian superpower has sought to isolate Taiwan and expand its power on the global stage, Chinese trade and investment in Latin America has soared.</p><p>Between 2005 and 2020, the Chinese have invested more than $130 billion in Latin America, according to the United States Institute of Peace. Trade between China and the region has also shot up, and is expected to reach more than $700 billion by 2035.</p><p>Honduras’ move came in conjunction with the construction of a hydroelectric dam project built by the Chinese company SINOHYDRO with about $300 million in Chinese government financing.</p><p>It left Taiwan with no more than 13 official diplomatic partners. More than half of those are small countries in Latin America and the Caribbean: Belize, Guatemala, Paraguay, Haiti, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. </p><p>At the same time Chinese influence has grown, lagging spending by the U.S. — Taiwan’s primary ally and source of defensive weaponry — has caused its sway in Latin America to slip.</p><p>For decades, China has claimed Taiwan as its own territory <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-politics-china-government-germany-88cd9b9fcead9d5dba0e8ea364f4dac6">to be brought under its control by force if necessary,</a> but the Taiwanese public overwhelmingly favors the current state of de-facto independence.</p><p>China has spent a great amount of effort in its campaign to diplomatically isolate Taiwan ever since Tsai’s election in 2016, successfully convincing nine countries to break off relations with Taipei since she has been in office.</p><p>China’s government views Tsai and her independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party as separatists. </p><p>In recent months, tensions have only intensified as relations between Beijing and Washington have spiraled. As a result, regions like Central America have grown in geopolitical importance.</p><p>“While our policy has not changed, what has changed is Beijing’s growing coercion – like trying to cut off Taiwan’s relations with countries around the world,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a speech about China relations last year.</p><p>Guatemala and Belize are among those who have remained steadfast supporters of Taiwan, Guatemala’s government reaffirming in March its “recognition of Taiwan as an independent nation with which democratic values ​​and mutual respect are shared.”</p><p>Yet analysts say their allegiance is also a political calculation.</p><p>Tiziano Breda, researcher at International Affairs Institute, said that position will likely be wielded politically, used as a potential shield against pressure from the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. government, for example, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-caribbean-biden-cabinet-guatemala-city-092255f2620cf60aa0e2a6a98f1b995d">has been highly critical</a> of the administration of President Alejandro Giammattei for not doing enough to crack down on corruption.</p><p>“It’s a card these countries wait to play,” Breda said.</p><p>Dreyer of University of Miami said many of Taiwan's allies will use their relationship with both China and Taiwan as a “bargaining chip” to seek greater investment and monetary benefits from both countries.</p><p>She said in Ing-wen’s meetings with Guatemala and Belize, the president is likely to offer investment and development projects contingent on maintaining good relations with her country.</p><p>But Dreyer noted that given the power China wields on a world stage, it’s only a matter of time before the economic superpower pulls Taiwan’s final diplomatic partners onto their side.</p><p>The Chinese "are not only willing to wait, but eager to wait until they think the time is ripe,” Dreyer said. “They want the most auspicious moment possible.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Huizhong Wu in Taipei contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A founding member of the 1990s hip-hop group the Fugees was enmeshed in political conspiracies involving millions of dollars in foreign money under two different U.S. presidents, federal prosecutors said as his trial got underway with opening statements Thursday. </p><p>Prakazrel “Pras” Michel <a href="https://apnews.com/article/music-north-america-campaign-contributions-ap-top-news-elections-852e3aa86a604597b99c5e81179a7b6b">is accused</a> of funneling money from a fugitive Malaysian financer through straw donors to Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. Five years later, prosecutors say he tried squelch an investigation into the financer and persuade then-President Donald Trump's administration to return to China a “vocal critic of the government." </p><p>“This is a case about foreign money, foreign influence and concealment,” said prosecutor Nicole Rae Lockhart. Michel pocketed over $100 million in the saga involving “political intrigue, backroom dealing, ... burner phones and lies,” she said. </p><p>Michel's lawyers have previously said he is innocent and “extremely disappointed” in the charges, but the defense decided to wait to give its opening statement in the trial that's expected to last weeks. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The Department of Justice says Michel conspired with Low Taek Jho, usually known as Jho Low. The fugitive financer is accused of masterminding a money laundering and bribery scheme that pilfered billions from the Malaysian state investment fund known as 1MDB.</p><div id="afs:Card:148376116072" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="ea33822cc98ce6172a66c617581c2ed4">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Looted money paid for jewelry and luxury art and helped finance Hollywood films like “The Wolf of Wall Street.”</p><p>Low was once known for his business and social ties to American celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Leonardo DiCaprio, a possible witness in the case. During the 2012 presidential campaign, prosecutors allege Low directed more than $20 million to Michel, who concealed its origin by giving the money to straw donors to give to the Obama campaign. He later tried to lean on the donors to keep them from talking to investigators, Lockhart said.</p><p>In 2017, prosecutors say, the Grammy-winning rapper worked with a Republican “fixer" to try and shut down a U.S. investigation into Low and embezzlement from the Malaysian fund. He's also accused of pushing the Trump administration to send a Chinese person who had fled to the U.S. back to China. </p><p>“It almost worked,” Lockhart said. “The defendant wanted money and was willing to break any laws necessary to get paid.” </p><p>The Justice Department last year announced charges against Low and two former <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-malaysia-najib-razak-asia-538f0543e305ccf31b665c3fca6c01bf">Goldman Sachs bankers</a> in the money laundering and bribery scheme that pilfered money from the fund, which was created to spur economic development projects in Malaysia. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence. </p><p>One of the bankers, Roger Ng, was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/roger-ng-goldman-sachs-malaysia-1mdb-najib-5caee7298daf6fd088911ce5c6f4a58d">sentenced to 10 years in prison</a> this month for his role in the scheme. </p>]]></description>

The focus, she said, should be on tech that “can lead to the development of military capabilities that pose risks to national security.”</p><p>The commission president’s speech comes as the EU reconsiders its frequently testy relations with China, notably in light of Beijing’s support for Russia’s war on Ukraine. Von der Leyen said, though, that it’s important not to cut political, economic or scientific ties with such a “vital trading partner.”</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron is also due to travel to China next week and will take part in some events involving von der Leyen. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was set to visit Beijing on Thursday and Friday at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>]]></description>

Their relevant actions are groundless accusations, far fetched, and lack professionalism.”</p><p>Chinese authorities have consistently denied any form of state-sponsored hacking, instead saying China itself is a major target of cyberattacks.</p><p>APT41 was implicated in a 2020 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-media-social-media-crime-china-abe63876eedc5a95c90a37ca88024809">U.S. Justice Department</a> indictment that accused Chinese hackers of targeting more than 100 companies and institutions in the U.S. and abroad, including social media and video game companies, universities and telecommunications providers.</p><p>In its analysis, Insikt Group said it found evidence that RedGolf “remains highly active” in a wide range of countries and industries, “targeting aviation, automotive, education, government, media, information technology and religious organizations.” </p><p>Insikt Group did not identify specific victims of RedGolf, but said it was able to track scanning and exploitation attempts targeting different sectors with a version of the KEYPLUG backdoor malware also used by APT41. </p><p>Insikt said it had identified several other malicious tools used by RedGolf in addition to KEYPLUG, “all of which are commonly used by many Chinese state-sponsored threat groups.”</p><p>In 2022, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant reported that APT41 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-united-states-hacking-ffa2120239eb687ce1979bf9599dfea5#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20Hackers%20working,by%20a%20private%20cybersecurity%20firm.">was responsible</a> for breaches of the networks of at least six U.S. state governments, also using KEYPLUG.</p><p>In that case, APT41 exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in an off-the-shelf commercial web application used by 18 states for animal health management, according to Mandiant, which is now owned by Google. It did not identify which states’ systems were compromised.</p><p>Mandiant called APT41 “a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity in addition to financially motivated activity potentially outside of state control.”</p><p>Cyber intelligence companies use different tracking methodologies and often name the threats they identify differently, but Condra said APT41, BARIUM and RedGolf “likely refer to the same set of threat actor or group(s)” due to similarities in their online infrastructure, tactics, techniques and procedures. </p><p>“RedGolf is a particularly prolific Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group that has likely been active for many years against a wide range of industries globally,” he said.</p><p>“The group has shown the ability to rapidly weaponize newly reported vulnerabilities and has a history of developing and using a large range of custom malware families.” </p><p>Insikt Group concluded that the use of KEYPLUG malware through certain types of command and control servers by RedGolf and similar groups is “highly likely to continue” and recommended that clients ensure they are blocked as soon as they are detected.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BEIJING (AP) — As <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-central-america-tsai-us-ba1757919410805cf97f9a0943a1cecb">Taiwan's president began a stopover in the United States</a> on her way to Central America, China said it was closely watching and would “resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.”</p><p>China claims Taiwan as its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary, and portrays the self-governing island democracy of 23 million people as the most sensitive issue in its increasingly fraught relationship with the U.S.</p><p>On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reiterated China's furious objections to any meetings between Tsai Ing-wen and U.S. officials. </p><p>“China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan,” Mao told reporters at a daily briefing. “China will continue to closely follow the situation and resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.”</p><p>China has particularly warned that a meeting between Tsai and U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-reaction-tsai-mccarthy-meeting-taiwan-e1926816ce20590b2c7992fae8f8cd04">would bring a strong but unspecified response. </a></p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Neither Tsai nor McCarthy has formally confirmed a meeting. Tsai is scheduled to transit in Los Angeles on April 5. </p><p>In August, Beijing responded to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-asia-beijing-nancy-pelosi-taipei-938933cfaea62b31e7577b0a2a4f7006">then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan</a> by launching missiles, deploying warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and simulating a blockade of the island. China also temporarily suspended dialogue with the U.S. on climate and other major issues and restricted military-to-military communication with the Pentagon.</p><div id="afs:Card:344160070650" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="652813f8ce4d9804f372fd05ccaab435">Hub peek embed (Taiwan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Tsai's visit aims to show that Taiwan still has allies, despite China's military threats and attempts to isolate it diplomatically. Most recently, the Central American state of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-honduras-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-bf5c143768814fb6f9f3beff34f611d7">Honduras switched relations from Taiwan to China</a>, leaving Taiwan with just 13 formal diplomatic allies. Tsai accused Beijing of using “dollar diplomacy” to poach another Taiwanese ally. </p><p>Tsai is expected to meet with the American Institute in Taiwan chair, Laura Rosenberger. AIT is the U.S. government-run nonprofit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan.</p><p>While the U.S. terms relations with Taiwan as unofficial, it is the island's chief source of military hardware and cooperation.

China says it was a research balloon that was blown off course, but the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-china-antony-blinken-51e49202f2a0a50541cde059934c4cfb">Biden administration ordered it shot down</a> and canceled a planned visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China. </p><p>Along with Taiwan and friction over trade, technology and human rights, China’s close ties with Russia and its refusal to criticize Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine have also increased tensions between Washington and Beijing. </p><p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-china-xi-putin-meeting-d989e5c65ff762c1af91215d6dd2cf6e">visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week,</a> underscoring the warmth of the "no-limits” relationship between the two authoritarian states announced just weeks before Russia's year-old invasion. </p><p>China has provided Russia with an economic lifeline by buying the oil-rich country's resources. U.S. officials say they've seen indications Beijing is considering selling military hardware to Moscow, although they say there is no evidence that has happened yet. </p><p>Days after Xi's visit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told The Associated Press he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-russia-putin-bakhmut-2334ec3a5b74d3cc3c4e012db71920e5">hopes to meet with Xi in Kyiv.</a> China, which has put forward a peace proposal that says nothing about Russia withdrawing from Ukrainian territory it has seized, gave no immediate response about whether such a visit would take place.</p><p>Also Thursday, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Tan Kefei said Xi and Putin had reached “a number of important new points of consensus” during their Moscow meetings, laying out a "blueprint for the future of relations." </p><p>“Strategic communication and practical cooperation between the two militaries have never ceased moving toward a higher level,” Tan said at a monthly briefing. </p><p>While Tan repeated China's stance that its relations with Russia do not constitute a formal alliance and were not aimed at any third parties, the two have increasingly aligned their foreign policies in a challenge to the dominance of global affairs by the U.S. and other democracies. </p><p>He also pledged regular joint air and sea patrols, exercises and training as the two countries work together to implement "global security initiatives (and) jointly safeguard international fairness and justice." </p><p>China has been steadily building up its 2 million-member armed forces — already the world's largest standing military — as well as latest-generation fighter jets, aircraft carriers and highly capable warships. </p><p>U.S. military officials also say China is rapidly expanding its stockpile of nuclear weapons and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-relations-sabotage-development-taiwan-cb60a10bc988243af53c98f2c9e92104">recent tough talk by Xi and other Chinese officials</a> has heightened concerns over a potential attack on Taiwan or other U.S. interests.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/John Minchillo)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — In a highly sensitive U.S. visit, Taiwan’s president delivered the message Thursday that keeping her self-ruled island strong will help ensure the world’s safety — even as her travel is carefully calibrated to try to contain what <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-tsai-us-visit-china-warnings-updates-652813f8ce4d9804f372fd05ccaab435">furious Chinese officials</a> warn could be a strong response.</p><p>Taiwan is billing President Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to New York as simply a “transit," but she kept a full agenda of events Wednesday and Thursday before flying to Central America. </p><p>Most provocatively in the eyes of Beijing, her trip is expected to include a meeting with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy next week. In a sign of the sensitivity of her visit, little about Tsai’s full itinerary has been made public, and her events Thursday were closed to the news media. </p><p>The visit — while important for Taiwan in demonstrating its overseas support — is fraught for both Taiwan and the U.S. because China views Taiwan as its territory and treats any dealings between U.S. and Taiwanese officials as a challenge to its sovereignty.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Even with the precautions, Tsai’s trip, including any meetings with U.S. lawmakers, raises tensions at a time when both China and the U.S. and its allies are boosting their military preparedness for a possible confrontation in the Indo-Pacific. China’s often-stated determination to take Taiwan, by force if necessary, stands as one of the region’s main flashpoints.</p><div id="afs:Card:344160070650" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="ba1757919410805cf97f9a0943a1cecb">Hub peek embed (Taiwan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Chinese officials are focusing, angrily, on the expected meeting next week between Tsai and McCarthy. It would be one of the highest-level in-person meetings between U.S. and Taiwanese officials on U.S. soil. </p><p>Tsai emphasized Taiwan's perseverance in the face of daunting challenges in a closed-door speech Thursday night hosted by the Hudson Institute think tank, which awarded her its leadership award. </p><p>She said the Taiwanese public remains unswerving in its commitment to democracy, and that Taiwan is the responsible, calm side in contrast to China, which is raising tensions in cross-strait relations, according to Taiwan's official Central News Agency.</p><p>"She made a strong point that the defense of Taiwan is actually the defense of America,” said Miles Yu, a Hudson Institute director who attended the speech.</p><div id="79e0da7e7c604a3d8f5f5e84f0941e83" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>A few dozen pro-China demonstrators — holding signs declaring “One China” and “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China” — gathered behind police barricades outside the hotel where Tsai spoke. </p><p>The United States’ longstanding “one-China” policy acknowledges that the Chinese claim Taiwan as their territory. However, the U.S. does not endorse that claim and remains Taiwan's most important provider of military hardware and other defense assistance. </p><p>On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning restated China’s serious objections to any interactions between Tsai and U.S. leaders.</p><p>“China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan,” Mao told reporters in Beijing. “China will continue to closely follow the situation and resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.”</p><p>A senior Chinese diplomat in Washington, embassy charge d'affaires Xu Xueyuan, pointed to the anticipated meeting between Tsai and the U.S. House speaker as one that would have significant repercussions overall and a “serious, serious, serious” impact on U.S.-China relations.</p><p>Neither Taiwan nor McCarthy, a California Republican, has publicly confirmed any in-person get-together. Analysts have framed a session between the two outside Washington as possibly less provocative than a trip by McCarthy to Taiwan, which he has said he also intends to make</p><p>Beijing responded to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-asia-beijing-malaysia-a5a6acc391511c99b1b4c2d69e67b133">a visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> last August by launching missiles, deploying warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and simulating a blockade of the island. China also temporarily suspended dialogue with the U.S. on climate and other major issues and restricted military-to-military communication with the Pentagon.</p><p>The United States broke off official ties with Taiwan in 1979, when it formally established diplomatic relations with China. U.S. law requires Washington to treat all threats to the island as matters of “grave concern” but does not explicitly say whether the U.S. would commit troops.</p><p>Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he hoped any U.S. officials meeting unofficially with the Taiwanese president emphasize that American support for Taiwan is "strong and unequivocal.”</p><p>Tsai has made six previous trips through the U.S. during her presidency, meeting with members of Congress and members of the Taiwanese diaspora. Administration officials are underscoring that her trip is in line with what she and her predecessors have done in the past.</p><p>Tsai's "transit is consistent with our longstanding unofficial relationship with Taiwan and is consistent with the United States' one-China policy, which remains unchanged,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters. </p><p>“The People’s Republic of China should not use this transit as a pretext to step up any aggressive activity around the Taiwan Strait," Kirby said. “The United States and China have differences when it comes to Taiwan. But we have managed those differences for more than 40 years.”</p><p>Tsai told reporters before boarding her plane to the United States that “external pressure will not obstruct our resolution to engage with the world."</p><p>Tsai was expected to meet with the American Institute in Taiwan chair, Laura Rosenberger. AIT is the U.S. government-run nonprofit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan. </p><p>Tsai's stops in Central America are expected to shore up Taiwan's partnerships there, after Honduras this month <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-honduras-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-bf5c143768814fb6f9f3beff34f611d7">switched its diplomatic relations</a> from Taiwan to China. Tsai accused China of using “dollar diplomacy” to lure away Honduras. Worldwide, just 13 countries now officially recognize Taiwan. </p><p>Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said the visit is a chance for Tsai “to convey to the Congress how important the partnership between the U.S. and Taiwan is and what’s necessary to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”</p><p>Tensions between Washington and Beijing have grown as China under President Xi Jinping seeks to expand <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-relations-sabotage-development-taiwan-cb60a10bc988243af53c98f2c9e92104">its regional and global influence</a>. Passage of what the U.S. said was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/g-20-summit-politics-united-states-government-china-antony-blinken-0a0469109e8776f1676d7b813e46854f">a Chinese spy balloon</a> across the U.S. this winter heightened Americans' sense of challenge from China. China says it was a research balloon that was blown off course.</p><p>___</p><p>Knickmeyer and Mascaro reported from Washington.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley tried to force a Senate vote Wednesday on legislation that would ban TikTok from operating in the United States, but he was blocked by a fellow Republican as lawmakers in both chambers are still trying to figure out what action, if any, is appropriate against the social media app.</p><p>In trying to force a vote — a move that rarely works in the Senate, since one senator’s objection can block it — Hawley called TikTok “digital fentanyl” and argued it could give the Chinese government access to data from 150 million American users. His bill would block and prohibit U.S. transactions with TikTok’s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., within 30 days.</p><p>The bill “sends the message to Communist China that you cannot buy us,” Hawley said. </p><p>Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky objected to Hawley’s motion, arguing that trying to ban an app would violate the Constitution and anger <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-congress-hearing-bytedance-china-biden-ceo-a92f048762d6657f291affb7a0ce6386">the millions of voters</a> who use it. “Speech is protected whether you like it or not,” Paul said.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Hawley’s effort to bring attention to the issue comes a week after a combative House hearing in which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-ceo-congressional-hearing-bytedance-china-44d948c5b0ba18e2a714e0fa62d52779">lawmakers from both parties grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew</a> over his company's ties to China’s communist government, data security and harmful content on the app. Chew attempted to assure lawmakers that the hugely popular video-sharing app prioritizes user safety and should not be banned due to its Chinese connections. But the tense standoff gave new momentum to Hawley and other lawmakers who say it should be banned or limited.</p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="dc504ad560b949bd11e2970afd3669dd">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The Missouri senator said Congress “should act decisively to ban TikTok directly.” Other lawmakers have considered broader approaches, though there is no widespread consensus on any piece of legislation.</p><p>There is broad Senate support for bipartisan legislation sponsored by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., and South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, that does not specifically call out TikTok but would give the Commerce Department power to review and potentially restrict foreign threats to technology platforms. The White House has backed that bill, but it is unclear if it will be brought up in the Senate or if it could gather much support among House Republicans. </p><p>Another bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida would, like Hawley’s bill, ban U.S. economic transactions with TikTok, but would also create a new framework for the executive branch to block any foreign apps deemed hostile. His bill is cosponsored by Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., and Mike Gallagher, R-Wis.</p><p>Those pushing new legislation point to agreement on a bill passed in December <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-d33e58c76bb3c13297c72816ef4e6231">that banned TikTok from most government devices</a>. But despite the bipartisan desires, the varying proposals underscore how difficult it could be to find agreement on an unprecedented effort to ban or scale back an app that is used by millions of Americans.</p><p>Paul said trying to ban an app like TikTok is a slippery slope. He’s had videos censored by YouTube, he said, but he still believes the company has a right to exist.</p><p>“I despise these people, but I’m not going to vote to ban them,” he said. “We don’t ban things that are unpopular in the United States.” </p>]]></description>

China had no immediate response about whether a Xi visit to Ukraine would happen. </p><div id="e4f47280-c640-11ed-f1af-7f63f4472f70" class="related-story-embed"></div><p>China has been economically aligned and politically favorable toward neighboring Russia across many decades, and Beijing has provided Putin diplomatic cover by staking out an official position of neutrality in the war. Xi, a powerful leader who commands the resources of the world's most populous nation, is an important player in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and even China's lack of involvement is a potent statement. </p><p>Zelenskyy spoke to the AP aboard a train shuttling him across Ukraine, to cities near some of the fiercest fighting and others where his country’s forces have successfully repelled Russia’s invasion. Zelenskyy rarely travels with journalists, and the president’s office said AP’s two night train trip with him was the most extensive since the war began.</p><p>Zelenskyy has extended invitations to Xi before in recent months, but this explicit call to visit comes days after the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-putin-xi-us-ukraine-war-fcfd22eb1f48b3de6f115c2943c77169">Chinese leader visited Putin in Russia</a> last week. But the Ukrainian leader said he hasn't communicated with Xi for the duration of the conflict. </p><p>“We are ready to see him here,” Zelenskyy said. “I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have.”</p><div id="377cf2ce663e4471b951c29d002fa8ef" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning was asked whether Xi would accept an invitation from Zelenskyy — or whether one had been officially extended. She told reporters she had no information to give. She did say that Beijing maintains “communication with all parties concerned, including Ukraine.”</p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked whether a meeting between Xi and Zelenskyy would be useful to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, said Russian authorities “highly appreciate” China’s balanced position on the issue and “have no right to come up with any advice” on whether the two should meet. “The Chinese leader himself decides the appropriateness of certain contacts,” Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters Wednesday.</p><p>In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the United States supports talks between Xi and Zelenskyy, "and my goodness, we’ve been saying that for weeks.”</p><p>Xi's Russia visit last week raised the prospect that Beijing might be ready to provide Moscow with the weapons and ammunition it needs to refill its depleted stockpile. But Xi’s trip ended without any such announcement. Days later, Putin announced that he would be deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which neighbors Russia and pushes the Kremlin’s nuclear stockpile closer to NATO territory.</p><p>Zelenskyy suggested Putin’s move was intended to distract from the lack of guarantees he received from China. </p><p>“What does it mean? It means that the visit was not good for Russia,” Zelenskyy speculated. </p><p>___</p><p>Julie Pace is senior vice president and executive editor of The Associated Press.

At home, Biden pointed to his stalled push for voting protections in Congress as evidence of his administration's commitment to support democracy.</p><p>“Today, we can say, with pride, democracies of the world are getting stronger, not weaker," Biden said. “Autocracies of the world are getting weaker, not stronger. That’s a direct result of all of us."</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The summits, which Biden promised as a candidate in 2020, have become an important piece of his administration's effort to try to build deeper alliances and nudge autocratic-leaning nations toward at least modest changes.</p><div id="afs:Card:530404428163" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="abd53580d1e8c64c3b5b44e67d83fb73">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>He said the U.S. will spend $690 million bolstering democracy programs — supporting everything from free and independent media to free and fair elections — around the world. He said he also wanted to use the summit to foster discussion about the use of technology to “advance democratic governance” and ensure such technology is “not used to undermine it.”</p><p>The U.S. also signed a joint statement with nine other countries to deepen international cooperation on countering the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware. Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom signed on the agreement.</p><p>About 40 participants had signed on, as of Wednesday, to a set of guiding principles for how the governments should use surveillance technology, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement before its formal announcement. The guidelines are to be published before the close of the summit on Thursday.</p><div id="b9a5f459e022457cb3f7d28d45229a49" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The White House announced plans for the U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency to partner with nine other countries to work on protecting human rights and other activist groups that are at risk of facing transnational cyber attacks. The UK is co-leading the effort and Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France, Japan, New Zealand and Norway have also signed on.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/commercial-spyware-white-house-biden-a947493bbca2848b28485f955089385b">Biden signed an executive order</a> restricting the U.S. government's use of commercial spyware tools that have been used to surveil human rights activists, journalists and dissidents around the world.</p><p>Since Biden's first democracy summit in December 2021, countries have emerged from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia invaded <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">Ukraine</a>, the largest-scale war in Europe since World War II. </p><p>Ukraine's president, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-russia-putin-bakhmut-2334ec3a5b74d3cc3c4e012db71920e5">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a>, pushed back at those suggesting it was time for a negotiated settlement with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. “We should get rid of the illusion that compromising with evil can give something to freedom, and enemies of democracy must lose,” Zelenskyy told the summit.</p><p>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the invasion was a jolting moment for the world's democracies.</p><p>“For decades, the idea of war in Europe seemed unthinkable. But we were wrong as Russia’s brutalization of Ukraine has shown we cannot assume that democracy, freedom and security are givens, that they are eternal,” Rutte said.</p><p>Kenya's president, William Ruto, said building democracy was was essential to the growth of developing nations. Ruto was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-elections-presidential-kenya-41cec0a771a1fe7f0f5a0e83761b03a9">the winner</a> last year of Kenya's close presidential race in which opposition candidate Raila Odinga <a href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-elections-presidential-kenya-uhuru-kenyatta-c9f2ccef66f2267fe4aee0afdb8c9acc">had alleged irregularities.</a> Kenya’s Supreme Court unanimously rejected the challenges.</p><p>“This is our path to sustainable development,” Ruto said.</p><p>The U.S. hosted the last summit on its own. This time, it recruited four co-hosts — Costa Rica, the Netherlands, South Korea and Zambia — after ambassadors from China and Russia criticized the first summit and accused Biden of causing a global divide with a Cold War mentality.</p><p>Still, some countries would rather not get between Washington and Beijing, an increasingly important economic and military player.</p><p>Pakistan announced, as it did in 2021, that it received an invitation but would <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-summit-democracy-china-us-1c63360af6885bb151bb664b7170a61b">skip the summit</a>, a move seen in part as an effort by the impoverished Islamic nation to assuage longtime ally China, which was not invited.</p><p>Xu Xueyuan, the charge d’affaires of China's embassy in Washington, on Wednesday called the summit “at odds with the spirit of democracy.” </p><p>“The U.S. draws an ideological line between countries, and through its narrative of ‘democracy versus authoritarianism,' it has formed factions and caused divisions in the international community,” she said.</p><p>The Biden administration has also expanded its invitation list. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gambia, Honduras, Ivory Coast, Lichtenstein, Mauritania, Mozambique and Tanzania were invited this year after being left off the list in 2021. </p><p>The first day of the summit was convened in a virtual format and will be followed on Thursday by hybrid gatherings in each of the host countries.</p><p>Costa Rica will focus on the role of youth in democratic systems. The Dutch are taking on media freedom. South Korea is looking at corruption. Zambia is centering on free and fair elections</p><p>The U.S. is no stranger to the challenges facing democracies, including deep polarization and pervasive misinformation.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-michael-pence-electoral-college-elections-health-2d9bd47a8bd3561682ac46c6b3873a10">Lies spread</a> about the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-claims-biden-won-explained-bd53b14ce871412b462cb3fe2c563f18">2020 presidential election</a> by then-President Donald Trump and his supporters have convinced <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-presidential-election-2020-democracy-33823de7f22a601a192fc82eeb88e630">a majority of Republicans</a> that Biden was not legitimately elected, normalized harassment and death threats against election officials, and been used to justify efforts in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-texas-state-government-ohio-michigan-minnesota-180191725cee33b33f25ee838d60b840">Republican-controlled legislatures</a> to adopt new voting restrictions.</p><p>Later this year, the Supreme Court will rule in a case from Alabama that voting rights advocates fear could virtually dismantle the nearly 60-year-old Voting Rights Act. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-voting-rights-bill-collapses-27c888b4f9bf876520913d7036a942b0">Congressional efforts</a> to shore up that federal law and increase voting access have failed.</p><p>Biden came into office vowing that human rights and democracy would play significant roles in his approach to foreign policy. But he's faced criticism from some human rights activists for being too soft on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-2022-midterm-elections-biden-inflation-business-fa45f3023af51b1b7201f0c06d86f72d">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-africa-egypt-antony-blinken-37f682d24b006766698ed10b1c22d4a7">Egypt</a> over their human rights records. The administration sees both nations as important partners in bringing stability to the Middle East. </p><p>More recently, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-united-states-biden-netanyahu-judicial-overhaul-5d53ba11bfd5ebe0d2e2e668ad2ee5f1">Biden administration officials have been at odds with close ally Israel</a> as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tries to push forward a far-reaching <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-protesters-netanyahu-judicial-overhaul-delay-b6839620ae91492eaabe4b748120183c">judicial overhaul</a> that the U.S. worries will diminish Israel's democracy.</p><p>Netanyahu, in remarks at the summit's opening session, said Israel remained a “robust democracy” in the midst of “a very intensive public debate.”</p><p>“Democracy means the will of the people as expressed by a majority, and it also means protection of civil rights, individual rights. It’s the balance between the two,” he said. </p><p>Later Wednesday, Biden hosted President Alberto Fernández of Argentina, a summit participant, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-argentina-alberto-fernandez-imf-debt-economy-d369d30e2a233b3d8975c44b0c594e52">for talks.</a></p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Munir Ahmed in Islamabad, Tom Verdin in Sacramento, California, Daniel Politi in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Seung Min Kim, Ellen Knickmeyer, and Colleen Long contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Johnson Lai)</p></figcaption></figure>      <p>BEIJING (AP) — China threatened retaliation on Wednesday if U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy meets with Taiwan's president during her upcoming trip through Los Angeles.</p><p>President Tsai Ing-wen left Taiwan Wednesday afternoon on a tour of the island's diplomatic allies in the Americas, which she framed as a chance to demonstrate Taiwan’s commitment to democratic values on the world stage.</p><p>Tsai arrived in New York later in the day and was scheduled to spend Thursday in the city before heading to Guatemala and Belize. She is expected to stop in Los Angeles on her way back to Taiwan on April 5, when a meeting with McCarthy is tentatively scheduled.</p><p>The planned meeting has triggered fears of a heavy-handed Chinese reaction amid heightened friction between Beijing and Washington over U.S. support for Taiwan and trade and human rights issues.</p><p>The spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, Zhu Fenglian, denounced Tsai's stopovers and demanded that no U.S. officials meet with her.</p><p>“We firmly oppose this and will take resolute countermeasures,” Zhu said at a news conference. The U.S. should “refrain from arranging Tsai Ing-wen’s transit visits and even contact with American officials and take concrete actions to fulfill its solemn commitment not to support Taiwan independence,” she said.</p><p>Beijing claims self-governing Taiwan is part of its territory and threatens to bring the island under its control by force if necessary.</p><p>Speaking later Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China will “closely follow the development of the situation and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”</p><p>Mao said the United States was “conducting dangerous activities that undermine the political foundation of bilateral ties.”</p><p>McCarthy, a Republican from California, has said he will meet with Tsai when she is in the U.S. and has not ruled out the possibility of traveling to Taiwan in a show of support.</p><p>White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that Tsai's brief stops in the U.S. will be “consistent with our longstanding unofficial relationship with Taiwan and is consistent with the United States one China policy, which remains unchanged.”</p><p>“Every Taiwan president has transited the United States. President Tsai Ing-wen herself has transited the US six times since taking office in 2016, each time without incident," Kirby said. “The People’s Republic of China should not use this transit as a pretext to step up any aggressive activity around the Taiwan Strait. United States and China have differences when it comes to Taiwan. But we have managed those differences for more than 40 years.”</p><p>Following a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-pelosi-taiwan-visit-explainer-fd940b681b9a4165d2ace569bbfe33fb">visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in 2022</a>, Beijing launched missiles over the area, deployed warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and carried out military exercises in a simulated blockade of the island. Beijing also suspended climate talks with the U.S. and restricted military-to-military communication with the Pentagon.</p><p>Tsai told reporters before boarding her plane that “I want to tell the whole world democratic Taiwan will resolutely safeguard the values of freedom and democracy and will continue to be a force for good in the world, continuing a cycle of goodness, strengthening the resilience of democracy in the world.”</p><p>“External pressure will not obstruct our resolution to engage with the world,” she said.</p><p>Beijing has recently ramped up diplomatic pressure against Taiwan by poaching its dwindling number of diplomatic allies while also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-warplanes-us-tensions-af3f7aefba9cf5724fa121249ac64d28">sending military fighter jets flying toward the island</a> on a near-daily basis. Earlier this month, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-honduras-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-bf5c143768814fb6f9f3beff34f611d7">Honduras established diplomatic relations with China,</a> leaving Taiwan with only 13 countries that recognize it as a sovereign state.</p><p>U.S. administration officials in a call with reporters ahead of Tsai’s arrival said her previous stopovers in the U.S. have included meetings with members of Congress and members of the Taiwanese diaspora. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive visit, said Tsai is also expected to meet with American Institute in Taiwan chair Laura Rosenberger. AIT is the U.S. government-run nonprofit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan.</p><p>One official added that “there is absolutely no reason” for Beijing to use Tsai’s stopover “as an excuse or a pretext to carry out aggressive or coercive activities aimed at Taiwan.”</p><p>Beijing sees official American contact with Taiwan as encouragement to make the island’s decades-old de facto independence permanent, a step U.S. leaders say they don’t support. Pelosi was the highest-ranking elected American official to visit the island since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997. Under its “one China” policy, the U.S. acknowledges Beijing’s view that it has sovereignty over Taiwan, but considers Taiwan’s status as unsettled. Taiwan is an important partner for Washington in the Indo-Pacific.</p><p>U.S. officials are increasingly worried about China attempting to make good on its long-stated goal of bringing Taiwan under its control. The sides split at the end of a civil war in 1949 and Beijing sees U.S. politicians’ visits as conspiring with Tsai’s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party to make the separation permanent and stymy China’s rise as a global power.</p><p>The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which has governed U.S. relations with the island, does not require Washington to step in militarily if China invades but makes it American policy to ensure Taiwan has the resources to defend itself and to prevent any unilateral change of status by Beijing.</p><p>Tensions spiked earlier this year when U.S. President Joe Biden ordered a Chinese spy balloon shot down after it traversed the continental United States. The Biden administration has also said U.S. intelligence findings show that China is weighing sending arms to Russia for its war in Ukraine, but has no evidence Beijing has done so yet.</p><p>China, however, has provided Russia with an economic lifeline and political support, and President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in Moscow earlier this month. That was the first face-to-face meeting between the allies since before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago.</p><p>The Biden administration postponed a planned visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony Blinken following the balloon controversy but has signaled it would like to get such a visit back on track.</p><p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao said the blame for tensions lies squarely with Washington for boosting relations with Tsai. Beijing has frozen almost all contacts with Tsai’s administration since shortly after she was elected to the first of her two terms in 2016.</p><p>“It is not that China overreacts. It is that the U.S. kept emboldening Taiwan independence forces, which is egregious in nature,” Mao said at a daily briefing.</p><p>Tsai’s state visits coincide with a 12-day trip to China by her predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, of the pro-unification Nationalist Party, in an appeal to voters whose descendants arrived with Chiang Kai-shek’s defeated forces in 1949.</p><p>Ma has been visiting sites in the former Nationalist capital of Nanjing and emphasizing historical and cultural links between the sides, while avoiding the politically sensitive topics of China’s determination to eliminate Taiwan’s international presence and refusal to recognize its government.</p><p>Tsai is barred from seeking a third term and her party is widely expected to nominate Vice President Lai Ching-te to run for the presidency in January.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Huizhong Wu in Taipei, Taiwan, and Aamer Madhani in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

Ukrainian forces have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-battle-for-kyiv-dc559574ce9f6683668fa221af2d5340">held their capital, Kyiv</a>, and pushed Russia back from other strategically important areas. </p><p>But as the war enters its second year, Zelenskyy finds himself focused on keeping motivation high in both his military and the general Ukrainian population — particularly the millions who have fled abroad and those living in relative comfort and security far from the front lines.</p><div id="7d46e5522f744ae187f21b451019afdc" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Zelenskyy is also well aware that his country's success has been in great part due to waves of international military support, particularly from the United States and Western Europe. But some in the United States — including Republican Donald Trump, the former American president and current 2024 candidate — have questioned whether Washington should continue to supply Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid. </p><p>Trump's likely Republican rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, also suggested that defending Ukraine in a “territorial dispute” with Russia was not a significant U.S. national security priority. He later <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ron-desantis-ukraine-republicans-2024-f44acc03f772f393b7f8d452ee26508a">walked that statement back</a> after facing criticism from other corners of the GOP. </p><p>Zelenskyy didn't mention the names of Trump or any other Republican politicians — figures he might have to deal with if they prevailed in 2024 elections. But he did say that he worries the war could be impacted by shifting political forces in Washington. </p><p>“The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win,” he said in the interview. He sipped tea as he sat on a narrow bed in the cramped, unadorned sleeper cabin on a state railway train.</p><p>The president's carefully calibrated railroad trip was a remarkable journey across land through a country at war. Zelenskyy, who has become a recognizable face across the world as he doggedly tells his side of the story to nation after nation, used the morale-building journey to carry his considerable clout to regions close to the front lines.</p><p>He traveled with a small cadre of advisers and a large group of heavily armed security officials dressed in battlefield fatigues. His destinations included ceremonies marking the one-year anniversary of the liberation of towns in the Sumy region and visits with troops stationed at front-line positions near Zaporizhzhia. Each visit was kept under wraps until after he departed. </p><p>Zelenskyy recently made a similar visit <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-bakhmut-9056fed0866bfb4c651283d85c895544">near Bakhmut</a>, where Ukrainian and Russian forces have been locked for months in a grinding and bloody battle. While some Western military analysts have suggested that the city is not of significant strategic importance, Zelenskyy warned that a loss anywhere at this stage in the war could put Ukraine’s hard-fought momentum at risk.</p><p>“We can’t lose the steps because the war is a pie — pieces of victories. Small victories, small steps,” he said. </p><p>Zelensky’s comments were an acknowledgement that losing the 7-month-long battle for Bakhmut — the longest of the war thus far — would be more of a costly political defeat than a tactical one.</p><p>He predicted that the pressure from a defeat in Bakhmut would come quickly — both from the international community and within his own country. “Our society will feel tired,” he said. “Our society will push me to have compromise with them.”</p><p>So far, Zelenskyy says he hasn't felt that pressure. The international community has largely rallied around Ukraine following Russia’s Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. In recent months, a parade of world leaders have visited Zelenskyy in Ukraine, most traveling in on trains similar to the ones the president uses to crisscross the country.</p><div id="c7322ffee5fb46c297b8d316fb449642" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>In his AP interview, Zelenskyy extended an invitation to Ukraine to one notable and strategically important leader who has not made the journey — Chinese President Xi Jinping. </p><p>"We are ready to see him here,” he said. “I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have.”</p><p>China, economically aligned and politically favorable toward Russia across many decades, has provided Putin diplomatic cover by staking out an official position of neutrality in the war.</p><p>Asked whether Xi would accept an invitation from Zelenskyy — or whether one had been officially extended — Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters she had no information to give. She did say that Beijing maintains "communication with all parties concerned, including Ukraine."</p><div id="d22878b020ad4375bb2a03e1b10bfdd5" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked whether a meeting between Xi and Zelenskyy would be useful to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, said Russian authorities “highly appreciate” China’s balanced position on the issue and “have no right to come up with any advice” on whether the two should meet. “The Chinese leader himself decides the appropriateness of certain contacts,” Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters Wednesday.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-putin-xi-us-ukraine-war-fcfd22eb1f48b3de6f115c2943c77169">Xi visited Putin in Russia last week</a>, raising the prospect that Beijing might be ready to provide Moscow with the weapons and ammunition it needs to refill its depleted stockpile. But Xi’s trip ended without any such announcement. Days later, Putin announced that he would be deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which neighbors Russia and pushes the Kremlin’s nuclear stockpile closer to NATO territory. </p><div id="d21cb3e7e6964f95acf81e2aa28bf7bb" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Zelenskyy suggested Putin’s move was intended to distract from the lack of guarantees he received from China. </p><p>“What does it mean? It means that the visit was not good for Russia,” Zelenskyy speculated. He was unsparing in his assessment of Putin, calling him an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war.</p><p>“He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskyy said.</p><p>The Ukrainian president makes few predictions about the biggest question hanging over the war: how it will end. He expressed confidence, however, that his nation will prevail through a series of “small victories" and "small steps" against a “very big country, big enemy, big army” — but an army, he said, with “small hearts.”</p><p>And Ukraine itself? While Zelenskyy acknowledged that the war has “changed us,” he said that in the end, it has made his society stronger. </p><p>“It could’ve gone one way, to divide the country, or another way — to unite us,” he said. “I'm so thankful. I’m thankful to everybody — every single partner, our people, thank God, everybody — that we found this way in this critical moment for the nation. Finding this way was the thing that saved our nation, and we saved our land. We are together.”</p><p>___</p><p>Julie Pace is senior vice president and executive editor of The Associated Press.

(AP) — <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a> said Tuesday that Republicans' ideas for cutting the budget could undermine U.S. manufacturing and help China dominate the world economy.</p><p>Speaking at a semiconductor maker in North Carolina to highlight his own policies, Biden is trying to shape public sentiment as he faces off with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., about whether the federal government should raise its legal borrowing capacity. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/mccarthy-biden-debt-ceiling-letter-b36995011ff69d6af5f8583d93436f0d">McCarthy sent a letter</a> Tuesday saying that talks should start about possible spending cuts in return for the debt limit increase. Biden has said Republicans need to put forth their own budget plan before negotiations start. Without an agreement, the federal government could default on its financial obligations. </p><p>The president tried to ratchet up pressure on Tuesday by saying that the GOP demands on the budget would only empower China, the country's key geopolitical rival. Being tough on China has been a core part of the identity of former President Donald Trump, who is seeking to return to the White House in 2024, and his Make America Great Again movement. The Democratic president said their objections to his policies would instead strengthen China.</p><div id="afs:Card:530404428163" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="a0e6309d998e21eb85ff101972898531">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“It would mean ceding the future of innovation and technology to China,” Biden told the crowd. “I’ve got news for you and for MAGA Republicans in Congress: not on my watch. We’re not going to let them undo all the progress we made.”</p><p>Biden's trip to Wolfspeed follows the Durham-based company announcing plans last September to build a $5 billion manufacturing facility in Chatham County that is expected to create 1,800 new jobs. Biden had won passage last July of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-science-technology-united-states-economy-2fa651c540c9869890dfe670bcdcb7ea">$280 billion legislative package</a> known as the CHIPS Act, which was intended to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry and scientific research.</p><p>It's nothing new for the Biden administration to highlight the CHIPS Act, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/house-vote-coronavirus-relief-package-33f4902ca9a2aed4e76274af6bb2ea5c">$1.9 trillion COVID relief bill</a>, the $1 trillion <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-infrastructure-bill-signing-b5b8cca843133de060778f049861b144">infrastructure legislation</a> and a roughly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/whats-in-senate-bill-4d5d4090a86b68dafc92030c3facff9d">$375 billion climate bill</a> — major legislation that the Democratic administration steered into law before Democrats lost control of the House.</p><div id="e428eeacff0044c3a03e38fda639672c" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>But now, just weeks after Biden unveiled <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-budget-debt-limit-deficit-republicans-56ed3a1b2ed906f89bc84edc435d3e7d">his own budget</a> — it includes $2.6 trillion in new spending — his administration is looking for chances to lean into its battle with Republicans over spending priorities and who has better ideas to steward the U.S. economy in the years to come. Republicans have rejected Biden's budget but have yet to unveil their own counteroffer to the Democrats' blueprint, which is built around tax increases on the wealthy and a vision statement of sorts for Biden’s yet-to-be-declared campaign for reelection in 2024.</p><p>His trip is part of a larger effort to draw attention to his policies, which have been overshadowed by high inflation.</p><p>Besides Biden's visit to Wolfspeed, Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and other senior administration officials will fan out to 20 states over the next three weeks to highlight the impact of Biden's economic agenda, according to the White House.</p><p>Biden has said he intends to run for a second term but has yet to formally launch his reelection campaign. </p><p>His effort to highlight legislative victories could also give him an opportunity to present voters with images of an administration focused on governing as Trump braces for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-manhattan-investigations-grand-jury-742461a52c86bb491667b085bc1aaa0b">a possible indictment</a>.</p><p>Trump is being investigated over payments during his 2016 campaign to two women who alleged affairs or sexual encounters with him. The ex-president denies being involved with either of the women — porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal.</p><p>Trump narrowly won North Carolina in 2020. Among the other states that Biden and administration officials will be visiting in the weeks ahead are Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin — crucial battlegrounds that Biden won in 2020 and states expected to be competitive again in 2024.</p>]]></description>

(Ma Ying-jeou Office via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>        <p>NANJING, China (AP) — Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou began a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-president-ma-yingjeou-visits-china-f915eca84948e2de19719546bb68ce24">12-day tour of China</a> with a symbolism-laden visit to the mausoleum where a founding figure revered in both China and Taiwan is entombed.</p><p>Ma visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, the capital when Ma's Nationalist Party (Kuomingtang) ruled China in the early part of the 20th century. The party claimed to be the legitimate ruler of China for decades and is seen as more sympathetic to integration or unification with the mainland than the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</p><p>There, he paid tribute to Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China and the Nationalist Party, giving a short speech and then bowing in front of the memorial. </p><p>“The people of both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the Chinese nation, are children of Yandi and the Yellow Emperor,” he told a group of Chinese and Taiwanese reporters who had been allowed to follow him on the trip, referring to mythical emperors revered as founders of China’s dominant Han ethnicity. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Ma's tour of China comes as tensions between Taiwan and China rise, aggravated by an antagonistic U.S.-China relationship. Taiwan, where the Kuomingtang retreated after losing the civil war in China, is today a self-governed democracy and the U.S. is its largest unofficial ally. China, however claims the island as its own. </p><div id="afs:Card:344160070650" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="90c8ce038e2a02d186b53ed4a975d88b">Hub peek embed (Taiwan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Ma's tour comes a few days after Taiwan <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-honduras-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-bf5c143768814fb6f9f3beff34f611d7">lost yet another diplomatic ally</a> to China, which has spent the past seven years pressuring countries to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China. </p><p>He has framed the trip as an effort to lower tensions by promoting exchanges, bringing Taiwanese college students with him on the visit, and has said he hopes that his trip could help lower tensions. Observers expect the visit to be more symbolic than substantive. </p><p>“Both sides must pursue peace, otherwise, neither will have a future,” he said.</p><p>Ma praised Sun, who advocated for a modern Chinese nation and the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. It was Sun who founded the Republic of China in 1912, and ruled over the mainland, very briefly. After the retreat to Taiwan, the Kuomingtang continued to call their nation the Republic of China. Meanwhile, the Communist Party took over the mainland in 1949, and renamed the country the People’s Republic of China.</p><p>Outside the mausoleum, a crowd of curious onlookers and tourists gathered in the morning to see if they could catch a glimpse of the former President. </p><p>Most of the regular tourists expecting to be able to see the mausoleum and the surrounding park found themselves blocked from entering, though a lucky few who had reserved in advance were allowed to enter the site.</p><p>“Even though there are some difficulties on the official front, as long as there are benefits to the public and you can build a good foundation, then this will be good for the unification of both sides,” said Chen Shao'an, who had come to the mausoleum to see Ma. </p><p>Ma is also visiting the China Modern History Museum, which is the site of the old Presidential Palace in Nanjing.</p><p>—-</p><p>Wu reported from Taipei, Taiwan. Olivia Zhang in Nanjing contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to show the name of Taiwan's ruling party is the Democratic Progressive Party, not the Democratic People’s Party.</p>]]></description>

(AP) — Scientists have discovered a new and renewable source of water on the moon for future explorers in lunar samples from a Chinese mission. </p><p>Water was embedded in tiny glass beads in the lunar dirt where meteorite impacts occur. These shiny, multicolored glass beads were in samples returned from the moon by China in 2020. </p><p>The beads range in size from the width of one hair to several hairs; the water content was just a miniscule fraction of that, said Hejiu Hui of Nanjing University, who took part in the study. </p><p>Since there are billions if not trillions of these impact beads, that could amount to substantial amounts of water, but mining it would be tough, according to the team.</p><p>“Yes, it will require lots and lots of glass beads,” Hui said in an email. “On the other hand, there are lots and lots of beads on the moon." </p><p>These beads could continually yield water thanks to the constant bombardment by hydrogen in the solar wind. The findings, published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, are based on 32 glass beads randomly selected from lunar dirt returned from the Chang'e 5 moon mission. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>More samples will be studied, Hui said.</p><p>These impact beads are everywhere, the result of the cooling of melted material ejected by incoming space rocks. Water could be extracted by heating the beads, possibly by future robotic missions. More studies are needed to determine whether this would be feasible and, if so, whether the water would be safe to drink. </p><div id="afs:Card:919354934208" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="28447e31610ad93a78c140ef518086ac">Hub peek embed (apf-science) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>This shows “water can be recharged on the moon’s surface ... a new water reservoir on the moon,” Hui said.</p><p>Previous studies found water in glass beads formed by lunar volcanic activity, based on samples returned by the Apollo moonwalkers more than a half-century ago. These, too, could provide water not only for use by future crews, but for rocket fuel.</p><p>NASA aims to put astronauts back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025.

(Opéra national de Paris via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>PARIS (AP) — After spending decades portraying generals' wives, a countess and a courtesan, Renée Fleming walked gingerly onto the stage of the Bastille Opera in a blond wig, red coat and black gloves to depict Pat Nixon, former first lady of the United States.</p><p>John Adams’ “Nixon in China,” a 1987 work among the most acclaimed American operas, received its Paris Opera premiere on Saturday night to eight minutes of applause following a revelatory production by Argentine director Valentina Carrasco that replaced literalism with metaphor. The lasting images were of a dark American eagle pitted against a bright red Chinese dragon and of ping-pong tables symbolizing both diplomacy and the quest for superiority.</p><p>“You really have to be in your mid-60s to even remember this other than as it’s something that you learn about in school,” said Fleming, a 64-year-old soprano who bid farewell to the standard repertory six years ago. “I’m sorry, but in the context of what’s going on now, Watergate doesn’t seem quite as horrific as it did at the time.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Thomas Hampson, a 67-year-old American baritone, starred as President Richard Nixon, complete with hunched shoulders and a sweaty face he repeatedly dabbed with a white handkerchief. Hampson broke out Nixon’s stiff V-for-victory motion with arms outstretched during curtain calls.</p><div id="afs:Card:148376116072" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9c64fccef6761802a5fc6e7daec5487c">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Hampson was a high school senior in Spangle, Washington, when Nixon made the seven-day trip to China in 1972, the first visit by an American president following the 1949 communist revolution.</p><p>“The whole effort of an American president to just simply shake hands across the globe was extremely impressive,” Hampson said. “Nixon will always and forever be Watergate. But there are parts of the presidency of Richard Nixon and parts of Richard Nixon that we just have to parse out and respect for what it is.”</p><p>Adams, now 76, made the trip from his California home and signed autographs during intermission, then joined the curtain calls. He wrote the opera with librettist Alice Goodman.</p><p>“They are larger-than-life characters. They created these personae, as most politicians do, but between Mao and Kissinger and Madam Mao and Nixon, they’re kind of political archetypes and I think that just captures the public imagination,” he said.</p><p>“Nixon” launched at the Houston Grand Opera with realistic sets by Peter Sellars that were reproduced for the 2011 Metropolitan Opera premiere. The Paris Opera became the first major European house to stage it, and “Nixon” debuts at Madrid’s Teatro Real on April 17 in a John Fulljames staging that first appeared at the Royal Danish Opera in 2019.</p><p>Fleming was making her Santa Fe Opera debut on a rainy night in August 2019 when company artistic director Alexander Neef approached her with an idea.</p><p>“He said, `I’m going to Paris and I want you to come for the first three of my seasons,'” Fleming recalled Neef saying of his job starting in 2021-22. “I was sort of shocked and said, `Well, let me see what I can think of that I could sing.’”</p><p>Carrasco, now 49, was living in Rome in 2020 and rushed to see the monument Ara Pacis Augustae after an impending pandemic closure was announced. While walking in, she received a call from Neef asking her to stage “Nixon.”</p><p>“I thought it was a sign,” Carrasco said</p><p>She had a flash to a childhood memory of seeing “From Mao to Mozart,” a film with violinist Isaac Stern that won the 1981 Academy Award for best documentary feature. A segment stuck in her head in which Stern gives a master class and tells a student to swing her instrument while playing as if swinging a ping-pong paddle.</p><p>“Ping-pong is good because it’s like a terrain divided in two, like the Cold War, an Iron Curtain in-between,” Carrasco said. “It’s a winner-loser situation, and I thought it was an interesting metaphor for the world. And Ping-Pong is a very beautiful choreographic for a visual. And the tiktok, tiktok, tiktok of the ping-pong ball reminded me of many places where the music is very percussive. And then, of course, there was Ping-Pong Diplomacy.”</p><p>Gustavo Dudamel conducts a strong cast that includes Xiaomeng Zhang as Chou En-lai, Joshua Bloom as Henry Kissinger, John Matthew Myers as Mao Tse-Tung and Kathleen Kim as Madame Mao. There are seven more performances through April 16, and the April 7 show will be streamed in France and aired later on Medici and Mezzo.</p><p>Carrasco splits the stage in two levels early on, scenes of diplomacy on top and torture on the bottom.</p><p>Kissinger plays table tennis against Chou, each dressed like a wrestler entering a ring. Chou wins the match 69-1 — China repeatedly cheats by not crediting Kissinger with points he won. Carrasco had tried 49-3 during a rehearsal, using the numbers for the French constitution article that allowed the retirement age to be lowered without French Assembly approval.</p><p>A clip of the Stern film is shown between the second and third acts.</p><p>Fleming prepared by speaking with former Nixon aide Frank Gannon and reading Will Swift’s “Pat and Dick: The Nixons, an Intimate Portrait of a Marriage.”</p><p>“I didn’t know he was funny. I never would have guessed that,” Fleming said. “I didn’t know anything about her. So all of this material is really interesting. She was fiercely protective of him and of her children.” </p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Jon Elswick)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — China's global influence campaign has been surprisingly robust and successful in Utah, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-foreign-influence-utah-legislature-mormon-church-921526d0c8eda2732c361488d20dd1b4">an investigation by The Associated Press</a> has found.</p><p>The world's most powerful communist country and its U.S.-based advocates have spent years building relationships with Utah officials.</p><p>Legislators in the deeply conservative and religious state have responded by delaying legislation Beijing didn’t like, nixing resolutions that conveyed displeasure with China's actions and expressing support in ways that enhanced the Chinese government’s image.</p><p>The AP's investigation relied on dozens of interviews with key players and the review of hundreds of pages of records, text messages and emails obtained through public records’ requests. </p><div id="b4275c00-c640-11ed-a7ee-ad670791027a" class="related-story-embed"></div><p>Beijing’s success in Utah shows “how pervasive and persistent China has been in trying to influence America,” said Frank Montoya Jr., a retired FBI counterintelligence agent who lives in Utah.</p><p>“Utah is an important foothold,” he said. “If the Chinese can succeed in Salt Lake City, they can also make it in New York and elsewhere.”</p><p>Here are some key takeaways:</p><h2>LEGISLATIVE AND PR VICTORIES</h2><p>The AP review found that China and its advocates won frequent legislative and public relations victories in Utah. </p><p>Utah lawmakers recorded videos of themselves expressing words of encouragement for the citizens of Shanghai in early 2020, which experts said likely helped the Chinese Communist Party with its messaging. </p><p>The request came from a Chinese official as the government was scrambling to tamp down public fury at communist authorities for reprimanding a young doctor, who later died, over his warnings about the dangers posed by COVID-19. </p><p>Around the same time, Utah officials were thrilled when China's authoritarian leader Xi Jinping sent a letter to fourth grade students in Utah. A Republican legislator said on the state Senate floor that he “couldn’t help but think how amazing it was” that Xi would take the time to write such a “remarkable” letter. Another GOP senator gushed on his conservative radio show that Xi’s letter “was so kind and so personal.”</p><div id="afs:Card:610860613396" content-id="50015492bcd1e8eb9ebbaee19f5942a9" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout </div><p>The letter was heavily covered in Chinese state media, which quoted Utah students calling Xi a kind “grandpa” — a familiar trope in Chinese propaganda.</p><p>State lawmakers have frequently visited China, where they are often quoted in state-owned media in ways that support Beijing’s agenda.</p><p>“Utah is not like Washington D.C.,” then-Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, told the Chinese state media outlet in 2018 as the former president ratcheted up pressure on China over trade. “Utah is a friend of China, an old friend with a long history.”</p><h2>FBI SCRUTINY</h2><p>Utah Republican Sen. Jake Anderegg told the AP he was interviewed by the FBI after introducing a 2020 resolution expressing solidarity with China in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. It won nearly unanimous approval. A similar resolution, proposed by a Chinese diplomat, was publicly rejected by Wisconsin’s Senate. </p><p>Anderegg said the language was provided to him by Dan Stephenson, the son of a former state senator and employee of a China-based consulting firm.</p><p>Stephenson and another Utah resident, Taowen Le, are among China's most vocal advocates in Utah. </p><p>Both men have supported and sought to block resolutions, set up meetings between Utah lawmakers and Chinese officials, accompanied legislators on trips to China and provided advice on the best way to cultivate favor with Beijing, according to emails and interviews. Both have ties to what experts say are front groups for Beijing.</p><p>After embassy officials tried unsuccessfully last year to get staff for Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to schedule a get-together with China’s ambassador to the U.S., Le sent the governor a personal plea to take such a meeting.</p><p>“I still remember and cherish what you told me at the New Year Party held at your home,” Le wrote in a letter adorned with pictures of him and Cox posing together. “You told me that you trusted me to be a good messenger and friendship builder between Utah and China.” </p><p>Both men said their advocacy on China-related issues were self directed and not at the Chinese government's behest. Le told AP he has been interviewed twice over the years by the FBI.</p><p>The FBI declined to comment. </p><h2>TAILORED APPROACH</h2><p>Security experts say that China’s campaign is widespread and tailored to local communities. In Utah, the AP found, Beijing and pro-China advocates appealed to lawmakers’ affiliations with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, better known as the Mormon church, which is the state’s dominant religion and one that has long dreamed of expanding in China.</p><p>Le, who converted to the church decades ago, has quoted scripture from the Bible and the Book of Mormon in his emails and letters to lawmakers, and sprinkled in positive comments that Russell Nelson, the church’s president-prophet, has made about China.</p><h2>PART OF BROADER TREND</h2><p>Beijing's success in Utah is part of a broader trend of targeting “sub-national” governments, like states and cities, experts say.</p><p>It is not unusual for countries, including the U.S., to engage in local diplomacy. U.S. officials and security experts have stressed that many Chinese language and cultural exchanges have no hidden agendas. However, they said, few nations have so aggressively courted local leaders across the globe in ways that raise national security concerns. </p><p>In its annual threat assessment released earlier this month, the U.S. intelligence community reported that China is “redoubling” its local influence campaign in the face of stiffening resistance at the national level. Beijing believes, the report said, that “local officials are more pliable than their federal counterparts.”</p><p>Authorities in other countries, including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, have sounded similar alarms.</p><p>A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington told the AP that China “values its relationship with Utah” and any “words and deeds that stigmatize and smear these sub-national exchanges are driven by ulterior political purposes.”</p><p>___</p><p>Suderman reported from Washington. AP writer Fu Ting in Washington contributed to this story.</p>]]></description>

Alibaba was later investigated and fined $2.8 billion for breaching <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-7f61ed3c62a53e4e3552bfaf06994b33">antitrust rules</a> as Chinese authorities cracked down on the once-freewheeling technology industry.</p><p>In the past year, Ma has been travelling, with reports of sightings in Europe, Japan, Thailand and Hong Kong. His itinerary has been closely watched as a barometer of Beijing’s attitude towards private businesses. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>On Monday, Ma visited the Yungu School in Hangzhou, in eastern China, that was established by Ma and other partners of Alibaba, according to a WeChat post by the school. Ma discussed technologies such as the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, and spoke of his passion for learning. </p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="c91238036e2f4d6fa5e2e036b79b0eb7">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Chinese government has been seeking to raise confidence in the private sector after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-china-technology-business-b0d67d0f2a0e4a8833c4e0d01ec84e8b">regulatory crackdowns,</a> on technology, education, online gaming and financial companies, and harsh COVID-19 restrictions slowed the economy. </p><p>Earlier this month, China’s newly-appointed premier, Li Qiang, sought to reassure entrepreneurs and investors by saying the government would provide “unswerving” support for the private sector. The commitment to this was “unequivocal and steadfast,” he said. </p><p>Ma stepped down as Alibaba chairman in 2019, saying he hoped to focus on philanthropy. In January, he ceded control of Ant, the financial technology firm, amid a revamp of its shareholding structure. </p><p>The same month, a top Chinese central bank official said that the c <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-china-government-business-930e13900317684c3e4124b799bcaab9">rackdown on the internet industry</a> was “basically” over.</p>]]></description>

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/topics_665678/2015zt/xjpdmgjxgsfwbcxlhgcl70znxlfh/201510/t20151013_705319.html">during a trip</a> to the U.S. in 2015 that “without successful cooperation at the sub-national level it would be very difficult to achieve practical results for cooperation at the national level.”</p><p>A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington told the AP that China “values its relationship with Utah” and any “words and deeds that stigmatize and smear these sub-national exchanges are driven by ulterior political purposes.”</p><p>It is not unusual for countries, including the U.S., to engage in local diplomacy. U.S. officials and security experts have stressed that many Chinese language and cultural exchanges have no hidden agendas.

Beijing believes, the report said, that “local officials are more pliable than their federal counterparts.”</p><p>The National Counterintelligence and Security Center in July <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/SafeguardingOurFuture/PRC_Subnational_Influence-06-July-2022.pdf">warned</a> state and local officials about “deceptive and coercive” Chinese influence operations. And FBI Director Christopher Wray last year <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/countering-threats-posed-by-the-chinese-government-inside-the-us-wray-013122">accused</a> China of seeking to “cultivate talent early—often state and local officials—to ensure that politicians at all levels of government will be ready to take a call and advocate on behalf of Beijing’s agenda.”</p><p>Authorities in other countries, including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/beijing-global-trade-australia-coronavirus-pandemic-victoria-d289b7a2874b6b1718338c4acc822004">Australia</a>, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-chinas-vancouver-consulate-interfered-in-2022-municipal-election/">Canada</a> and the <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/news/speech-by-mi5-and-fbi">United Kingdom</a>, have sounded similar alarms.</p><p>Those concerns have arisen amid <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-congress-2023-qin-us-1938a701c0d7a2114a18226962de4879">escalating disputes</a> between the U.S. and China over trade, human rights, the future of Taiwan and China’s tacit support for Russia during its invasion of Ukraine.

The AP focused its investigation on Utah because China appears to have cultivated a significant number of allies in the state and its advocates are well-known to lawmakers. </p><p>Relying on dozens of interviews with key players and the review of hundreds of pages of records, text messages and emails obtained through public records’ requests, the AP found China won frequent legislative and public relations victories in Utah.</p><p>China-friendly lawmakers, for example, delayed action for a year to ban Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes at state universities, according to the legislation’s sponsor. The Chinese language and cultural programs have been described by U.S. national security officials as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mike-pompeo-education-china-asia-pacific-95025c52081b9722e5afca23fe0a43b9">propaganda</a> instruments. The University of Utah and Southern Utah University closed their institutes by last year. </p><div id="6eb50c235d9647ce8ae77dbee3e7cd65" class="audio-embed"></div><p>In 2020, China scored an image-boosting coup when Xi sent a note to a class of Utah fourth-graders thanking them for cards they’d sent wishing him a happy Chinese New Year. He encouraged them to “become young ‘ambassadors’ for Sino-American friendship.”</p><p>Emails obtained by the AP show the Chinese Embassy and the students’ Chinese teacher coordinated the letter exchange, which resulted in heavy coverage by state-controlled media in China.</p><p>A Chinese state <a href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1660040015405841564&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc">media outlet reported</a> the Utah students jubilantly exclaimed: “Grandpa Xi really wrote back to me. He’s so cool!” Portraying China’s most authoritarian leader in decades as a kindly grandfather is a familiar trope in Chinese propaganda.</p><p>Xi's letter garnered positive attention in Utah, too. A Republican legislator said on the <a href="https://le.utah.gov/av/floorArchive.jsp?markerID=111099">state Senate floor</a> that he “couldn’t help but think how amazing it was” that the Chinese leader took the time to write such a “remarkable” letter. Another GOP senator gushed on his conservative <a href="https://redmeatradio.com/chinese-dual-language-immersion">radio show</a> that Xi’s letter “was so kind and so personal.”</p><p>Dakota Cary, a China expert at the security firm Krebs Stamos Group, said in making such comments Utah lawmakers are “essentially acting as mouthpieces for the Chinese Communist Party” and legitimizing their ideas and narratives.</p><p>“Statements like these are exactly what China’s goal is for influence campaigns,” he said.</p><h2>SPY AGENCY INTEREST</h2><p>China’s interest in Utah is not limited to its officials and advocates who are engaged in diplomacy, trade and education. U.S. officials have noted that China’s civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), has shown an interest in Utah, court records show.</p><p>In January, former graduate student Ji Chaoqun was sentenced to eight years in prison on charges related to spying for China. The Chicago student told an undercover agent he’d been tasked by his spy handlers “to meet people, some American friends." He was baptized at a Latter-day Saints church and told the undercover agent he'd “been going to Utah more often lately” before his arrest, according to his Facebook page and court records.</p><p>Ron Hansen, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/6e747d76619a4e6fa0021407dd285d74">a former U.S. intelligence official from Utah</a>, pleaded guilty to trying to sell classified information to China. Hansen said China's spy service had tasked him with assessing various U.S. politicians’ views towards China. The FBI found the names of Utah elected officials among sensitive files he stored on his laptop, court records show. Hansen was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-intelligence-officer-convicted-attempted-espionage-sentenced-10-years-federal-prison">sentenced in 2019 to serve 10 years</a> in federal prison. </p><p>Hansen was well known in Utah political circles and helped organize the first ever annual U.S.-China National Governors Forum, which was held in 2011 in Salt Lake City, according to court records and interviews. The U.S. State Department cancelled the forums in 2020 due to concerns about Chinese influence efforts.</p><h2>‘UTAH IS NOT LIKE WASHINGTON D.C.’</h2><p>The AP found groups of up to 25 Utah lawmakers routinely took trips to China every other year since 2007. Lawmakers have partially used campaign donations to pay for the trade missions and cultural exchanges, while relying on China and host organizations to pay for other expenses.</p><p>On the trips, they’ve forged relationships with government officials and were quoted in Chinese state-owned media in ways that support Beijing’s agenda. </p><p>“Utah is not like Washington D.C.,” then Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, told the Chinese state <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MO6lRxWC8MYMzAK6IsAqLw">media outlet</a> in 2018 as the former president ratcheted up pressure on Beijing over trade. “Utah is a friend of China, an old friend with a long history.”</p><p>In an interview last month with the AP, Hughes said the trips to China made him “bullish” about the country and prospects of improving trade. However, he said he now believes the visits were pretexts for Chinese officials to influence him and other lawmakers.</p><p>“It’s a trip not worth taking,” Hughes said.</p><p>Utah doesn’t require public officials to report in detail their foreign travel or personal finances, so it’s difficult to determine lawmaker’s financial ties to China. Some of Utah’s most pro-China legislators, however, have China-related personal business connections.</p><div id="4dd25201f439409fa796582ef24bcf7f" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Sen. Curt Bramble told <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/the-law-and-the-profits-inside-kratoms-political-underbelly/">Courthouse News Service</a> last year that his role as a part-time legislator and as a business consultant sometimes overlap and that he “had clients in China — a dozen at times — some of them on legislative tours, some on consulting.”</p><p>In an interview with AP, Bramble said none of his clients are based in China; they only do business there. He declined to name them.</p><p>Bramble, a Republican who represents a conservative district, also rejected fears of undue Chinese influence in Utah.</p><p>“China’s not going anywhere. China’s going to be a world force. They’re going to be a player for the foreseeable future and trying to understand what that implies for the United States or for the state of Utah and get a concept of that seems to be a valuable endeavor,” he said.</p><h2>TIES FORGED BY TWO UTAH RESIDENTS</h2><p>Many of the Utah-China ties have been forged by two state residents with links to the Chinese government or to organizations that experts say are alleged front groups for China, including its civilian spy agency, the AP found.</p><p>The two men advocated for and against resolutions, set up meetings between Utah lawmakers and Chinese officials, accompanied legislators on trips to China and provided advice on the best way to cultivate favor with Beijing, according to emails and interviews.</p><p>In reviewing the AP’s findings, legal experts said the men’s connections with Chinese officials suggest that they should register with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, known as FARA. The law generally requires anyone who works on behalf of a foreign entity to influence lawmakers or public perception, but its scope is the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-china-lawsuits-beijing-lobbying-ad7d6b41b9005071ddc1c827d905e7e9">subject of significant debate</a> and enforcement has been uneven. </p><p>“If I were representing either of these individuals, I would have significant concerns about FARA exposure,” said Joshua Ian Rosenstein, an attorney who handles such matters.</p><div id="4e02b39391504eb5a767b87d24a1a69b" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>One of the men, Taowen Le, has championed China to religious and political leaders in Utah for decades. Le, a Chinese citizen, moved to Utah in the 1980s and has been a professor of information technology at Weber State University since 1998. Le converted in 1990 to the Mormon faith.</p><p>From 2003 through 2017, Le had another job -- as a paid representative of China’s Liaoning provincial government. Provincial governments are largely controlled by Beijing and Liaoning has had a longstanding “sister” relationship with Utah.</p><p>Le’s advocacy continued after he said he left Liaoning’s payroll, emails and interviews show. He has frequently forwarded messages from Chinese government officials to Utah lawmakers and helped the Chinese Embassy set up meetings with state officials.</p><p>After embassy officials tried unsuccessfully last year to get staff for Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to schedule a get-together with China’s ambassador to the U.S., Le sent the governor a personal plea to take the meeting. </p><p>“I still remember and cherish what you told me at the New Year Party held at your home,” Le wrote in a letter adorned with pictures of him and Cox posing together. “You told me that you trusted me to be a good messenger and friendship builder between Utah and China.”</p><div id="caa24f6a36e7459fa959a7ab1066e6de" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>State Senate President Stuart Adams turned to Le when Utah was scrambling to obtain large quantities of drugs that Adams thought could be used as potential treatment against the coronavirus in early 2020, emails and interviews show.</p><p>Le, who belongs to the same congregation as Adams, said in an email to another lawmaker that he was able to get the Chinese Embassy to assign two staffers to work “tirelessly” on the request until it was fulfilled.</p><h2>RELIGIOUS SALES PITCH</h2><p>A hallmark of Le’s approach is to utilize his religion in his pitches to lawmakers. He quoted scripture from the Bible and the Book of Mormon in his emails, text messages and letters, and sprinkled in positive comments that Russell Nelson, the church’s president-prophet, has made about China.</p><p>Chinese officials have tried to cultivate friendly ties with the church. When visiting Utah, China's diplomats and officials often meet top church members as well as lawmakers, emails and other records show.</p><p>Expanding to China has been a top goal for the church, which plays a heavy role in Utah politics and the state's overall identity. Many of the state’s residents lived abroad as missionaries, and several of Utah’s public schools have robust K-12 Chinese immersion programs.</p><p>While the church has historically been an outspoken advocate for religious freedom, Le sought to stop Utah lawmakers from supporting religious figures or groups discriminated against by the Chinese government. </p><p>When a Utah lawmaker sponsored a resolution in 2021 condemning China’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-prisons-uyghurs-religion-0dd1a31f9be29d32c584543af4698955">well-documented</a> and brutal crackdown of its minority Muslim Uighurs, Le chastised the legislator in text messages and compared unflattering media coverage of the Chinese government to that of the church’s founder, Joseph Smith Jr.</p><p>“Pray to God and seek guidance from the Holy Spirit as you ponder about these issues instead of solely relying on those biased media reports,” Le said.</p><p>The resolution failed that year and a similar one introduced in January did not receive a hearing. </p><h2>CHINA'S ‘ADVANTAGES’ </h2><p>Le has served as a board member of the China Overseas Friendship Association, which has ties to the United Front Work Department -- a Chinese Communist Party organization the U.S. government says engages in covert and malign foreign influence operations.</p><p>A United Front publication profiled Le in 2020 after he attended a meeting in Beijing of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a prestigious advisory body controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>“I deeply feel the advantages of China’s system,” Le <a href="https://archive.ph/dmCu1">told the publication</a>.</p><p>Le told the AP he was interviewed by the FBI in 2007 and 2018 about his Chinese government ties. He said his advocacy has always been self-directed.</p><p>“I don’t consider myself a lobbyist because I’m not a lobbyist. I’m just someone who cherishes the relationship between the U.S. and China,” Le said in an interview in his Weber State office.</p><p>Adams, the Senate president, said he feels otherwise.</p><p>“I do believe he’s lobbying,” Adams said. “He advocates very hard on China.”</p><h2>LAWMAKER'S SON TURNED CHINA ADVOCATE</h2><p>Another Utah resident whom lawmakers said regularly has advocated better relations with China was Dan Stephenson, the son of a former state senator and employee of a China-based consulting firm.</p><p>Emails and other records show Stephenson advised the Utah senate president on how to make a good impression with a Chinese ambassador and assisted a Chinese province in its unsuccessful efforts to build a ceramics museum in Utah.</p><p>Stephenson has promoted China in Utah for several years and has boasted of being well connected with government officials there.</p><div id="c2532cb7f8e84baf994cc25a8b79a6c8" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“I’ve heard more than once from the mouths of Chinese government officials that China is prioritizing their relationship with Utah,” Stephenson told lawmakers at a committee hearing. That testimony came shortly after Stephenson accompanied Republican state Sen. Jake Anderegg on a trip to Shanghai and Beijing that included meetings with officials at China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>A few months after that trip, Stephenson provided Anderegg with the draft language for a pro-China resolution the state senator introduced in 2020 expressing solidarity with China during the pandemic, Anderegg told the AP.</p><p>The resolution passed with near unanimous approval.</p><p>A Chinese diplomat’s efforts to win passage of a similar <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-wisconsin-mike-pompeo-local-governments-william-barr-569c9e413abd9385f2d79bd6b3f6d5a4">resolution in Wisconsin failed</a>, with the state’s senate president publicly blasting it as a piece of propaganda.</p><p>Anderegg told the AP that he was interviewed by FBI agents seeking information about the Utah resolution’s origins.</p><p>“It seemed rather innocuous to me,” Anderegg said of his resolution. “But maybe it wasn’t.”</p><p>Stephenson said the FBI has not contacted him and no Chinese government official played a role in the resolution.</p><h2>TIES TO ALLEGED FRONT GROUPS</h2><p>Stephenson has links to Chinese groups allegedly active in covert foreign influence operations, documents show.</p><p>He is a partner in the Shanghai-based consulting firm Economic Bridge International. The company’s chief executive, William Wang, is a Chinese citizen and council member of the China Friendship Foundation for Peace and Development, according to an online biography. The group is affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front. </p><p>Stephenson, also once worked for the China Academy of Painting, which has been used by China’s Ministry of State Security as a front for meeting and covertly influencing elites and officials abroad, according to Alex Joske, the author of the recently published book “Spies and Lies: How China’s Greatest Covert Operations Fooled the World.”</p><p>Stephenson said he worked only briefly — without pay — for the China Academy of Painting. He added he did not witness any spy agency involvement. </p><h2>WORK ALIGNED WITH CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S DESIRES</h2><p>Stephenson said he’s never taken any action at the direction of the Chinese government and never accepted compensation from it. </p><p>“I work to promote Utah’s economy, to help American companies succeed in China, and to encourage healthy people-to-people and commercial ties,” Stephenson said.</p><p>His work sometimes aligned with what Chinese government officials were seeking and in ways experts say likely helped the Chinese Communist Party's messaging.</p><p>Stephenson urged Utah’s elected officials to make videos to air on Shanghai television to boost the spirits of that city’s residents early in 2020 as they battled COVID-19, according to emails obtained by AP.</p><p>“You cannot buy this type of positive publicity for Utah in China,” Stephenson said in an email pitching the videos.</p><p>The request originated with the Shanghai government, according to Stephenson’s email, and came as officials in China <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-health-ap-top-news-international-news-china-9d86cace1a89aa33d6b33138ab4d9ba6">were scrambling</a> to tamp down public fury at communist authorities for reprimanding a young doctor, who later died, over his repeated warnings about the disease's dangers.</p><p>Many lawmakers recorded videos reading sample scripts Stephenson provided, and a compilation of those videos was uploaded to a Chinese social media website. The compilation ends with dozens of lawmakers in unison shouting “jiayou!”- a Chinese expression of encouragement -- on the Utah House and Senate floors.</p><p>___</p><p>Suderman reported from Washington.

(Ma Ying-jeou Office via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) — Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou departed for a tour of China on Monday, in what he called an attempt to reduce tensions a day after Taiwan lost one of its few remaining diplomatic partners to China. </p><p>The ex-president is visiting in a private capacity, bringing a delegation of academics and college students for exchanges, as well as members of his family, but the trip is loaded with political meaning.</p><p>Ma’s policies brought Taiwan and Beijing to their closest relationship ever, but his exit from office was overshadowed by massive protests against a trade deal with the mainland and his successor has focused on bolstering ties with the U.S. and defending the autonomy of the democratically governed island that China claims as part of its own territory.</p><p>Current President Tsai Ing-wen is expected to launch a 10-day diplomatic tour of her own Wednesday, ostensibly to visit the island's remaining allies in Latin America. She <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-taiwan-president-us-visit-china-81cb55bce5fdbbdb0535b6b4129fa514">will stop in the U.S.</a>, Taiwan’s biggest unofficial partner and supplier of arms.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Ma's visit comes amid rising tensions. Beijing has stepped up pressure against Taiwan in recent years, poaching its diplomatic allies while also sending military fighter jets flying towards the island on a near daily basis. On Sunday, Honduras <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-honduras-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-bf5c143768814fb6f9f3beff34f611d7">established diplomatic relations with China</a>, leaving Taiwan with only 13 countries that recognize it as a sovereign state. </p><div id="afs:Card:344160070650" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="f915eca84948e2de19719546bb68ce24">Hub peek embed (Taiwan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Ma, a member of the opposition Nationalist Party (Kuomingtang), will land in Shanghai before starting his visit in nearby Nanjing. He is expected to tour the mainland from March 27 to April 7, stopping in Wuhan and Changsha, as well as other cities. He is bringing college students from Taiwan to meet with fellow students from Shanghai’s Fudan University and Changsha’s Hunan University.</p><p>Ma has framed the visit as a bid to lower the tensions in cross-strait relations through people to people exchange. “I hope through the enthusiasm of the youth and their interactions to improve the cross-strait mood, so bring peace faster, and earlier,” he said to reporters ahead of his departure on Monday afternoon. He said it would be his first time to visit China. </p><p>His trip has not drawn much controversy in Taiwan, where the public is used to seeing Kuomingtang politicians visit China. However, it has been criticized by some political opponents and activists. </p><p>A former mainland student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen square protests called on Ma to cancel his trip. “If you have even a strand of affection for Taiwan ... you should announce the cancellation of your trip,” said Wang Dan, a Chinese dissident who previously lived in Taiwan, on his Facebook page.</p><p>A handful of protesters from a pro-independence group held a demonstration at the departures area at Taoyuan airport before Ma's departure. “Ma Ying-jeou is humiliating our nation and forfeiting its sovereignty," they shouted before police carried them out. “You are a stinky beggar.”</p><p>On the other side, a small group of people from the pro-unification camp also came to the airport to show their support. “Cross-strait relations are like flowers blossoming in spring and both sides are a family," they shouted.</p><p>The trip is also a chance for him to honor his ancestors, ahead of Tomb Sweeping Day on April 5. During the festival, which is celebrated in Taiwan and China among other countries, families visit ancestral graves to maintain the burial grounds and remember the dead.</p><p>Ma will not go to Beijing, but may meet with Chinese officials.</p><p>Ma met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore in 2015, while he was still in office. The meeting was the first between the leaders of the two sides since Taiwan split from mainland China in 1949 during the Chinese civil war, but was considered more symbolic than substantive.</p><p>In 2016, the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won national elections and Beijing cut off contact with Taiwan’s government, citing Tsai's refusal to endorse the idea that Taiwan and China are one country.</p><p>___</p><p>Wu reported from Taipei. </p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — On the one side are dozens of lawmakers on Capitol Hill issuing dire warnings about security breaches and possible Chinese surveillance.</p><p>On the other are some 150 million TikTok users in the U.S. who just want to be able to keep making and watching short, fun videos offering makeup tutorials and cooking lessons, among other things. </p><p>The disconnect illustrates the uphill battle that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle face in trying to convince the public that China could use TikTok as a weapon against the American people. But many users on the platform are more concerned about the possibility of the government taking away their favorite app. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-shou-zi-chew-testify-7927b1915db270aac67ca6f4ca31d6f3">TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew</a> said during a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-ceo-congressional-hearing-bytedance-china-44d948c5b0ba18e2a714e0fa62d52779">nearly six-hour congressional hearing Thursday</a> that the platform has never turned over user data to the Chinese government, and wouldn’t do so if asked. </p><p>Nevertheless, lawmakers, the FBI and officials at other agencies continue to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-shou-zi-chew-8d8a6a9694357040d484670b7f4833be">raise alarms that Chinese law</a> compels Chinese companies like TikTok's parent company ByteDance to fork over data to the government for whatever purposes it deems to involve national security. There’s also concern Beijing might try to push pro-China narratives or misinformation through the platform.</p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" content-id="a92f048762d6657f291affb7a0ce6386" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>“I want to say this to all the teenagers out there, and TikTok influencers who think we’re just old and out of touch and don’t know what we’re talking about, trying to take your favorite app,” said Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw during the hearing. “You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but you will be one day.” </p><p>Many TikTok users reacted to the hearing by posting videos critical of lawmakers who grilled Chew and frequently cut him off from speaking. Some called a potential TikTok ban, as some lawmakers and the Biden administration has reportedly threatened, the “biggest scam” of the year. And others blamed the surge of scrutiny on the platform on another tech rival, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. </p><p>But few expressed fear of possible Chinese surveillance or security breaches that lawmakers continue to amplify as they look to rein in TikTok. </p><p>Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., whose district is in the heart of Silicon Valley, said he is mindful of the value that platforms like TikTok provide to young people as an outlet for creative expression and building community. “But there’s absolutely no reason that an American technology company can’t do that,” said Khanna, the top Democrat on the cyber subcommittee on House Armed Service. “America has the most innovative technology companies in the world.”</p><p>He added that Congress should move forward with a proposal that would force platform’s sale to an American company for continued access for its millions of users while “ensuring that the platform isn’t subject to Chinese propaganda or compromises people’s privacy.”</p><div id="00102630-c640-11ed-846b-79baff4ac684" class="related-story-embed"></div><p>According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, two-thirds of Americans aged 13 to 17 use TikTok, and 16% of all teens say they use it almost constantly. It's because of TikTok's large user base that Lindsay Gorman, a former tech adviser for the Biden administration who now works as a senior fellow for emerging technologies at the German Marshall Fund, says the Biden administration will likely pursue every option short of a ban first. That would include the option for the app's Chinese owners to divest, which the Biden administration is reportedly demanding from TikTok if it wants to avoid a nationwide ban.</p><p>TikTok itself has been trying to leverage its popularity. On Wednesday, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-china-62ebef6be3c10e66d7f69f7f6d254700">it sent dozens of influencers to Congress</a> to lobby against a ban. It has also ramped up a broader public relations campaign, plastering ads all over Washington that tout its promises of securing users’ data and privacy and creating a safe platform for its young users. </p><p>Some popular TikTokers who speak out against a ban are concerned — and angered — about how it might impact their personal lives. Many earn income from their videos and have inked brand partnerships to market products to their audiences — another stream of revenue that could be wiped away if the platform disappears. They would also lose the social capital that comes from having a large following on the trend-setting app. </p><p>Demetrius Fields, a standup comedian who amassed 2.8 million followers on TikTok from posting comedy sketches, said he spent a long time building his career and followership on the platform. He has one active deal with the fast fashion retailer Fashion Nova, which allows him to earn an income along with the videos he posts on TikTok. </p><p>If the app is taken away, he said building an audience on another platform would be challenging for him due to the competition to grab user attention. </p><p>“The financial implications for me would be pretty terrible,” Fields said. “I would probably have to go back to working a desk job.”</p><p>Sarah Pikhit, an 18-year-old student at Penn State University, said she used to use TikTok a lot, but started cutting back when she realized how much time she spent scrolling through videos on the app. She still uses it, but mostly to post her own content, which she says she can do on other platforms. She said she wouldn’t care if TikTok gets banned — but her friends would. </p><p>“They like the excessive scrolling,” Pikhit said. </p><p>—-</p><p>Associated Press writer Farnoush Amiri in Washington contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

Relations between Taiwan and Honduras were once stable, he said, but China had not stopped luring Honduras. </p><p>Honduras had asked Taiwan for billions of dollars of aid and compared its proposals with China's, Wu said. About two weeks ago, the Honduran government sought $2.45 billion from Taiwan to build a hospital and a dam, and to write off debts, he added. </p><p>“The Castro government dismissed our nation's longstanding assistance and relations and carried out talks to form diplomatic ties with China. Our government feels pained and regretful,” he said.</p><p>Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said her government would not “engage in a meaningless contest of dollar diplomacy with China.”</p><p>“Over these past few years, China has persistently used various means to suppress Taiwan’s international participation, escalate military intrusion, and disrupt peace and stability in the region,” she said in a recorded video.</p><p>Her office spokesperson Olivia Lin said in a statement that relations between the sides had lasted for more than 80 years.</p><p>Analysts have warned over the implications of the newly formed ties between China and Honduras. Political analyst Graco Pérez in Honduras said Beijing's narrative would highlight the benefits, including investment and job creation, “but that is all going to be illusory." </p><p>Pérez noted that some other countries have established such relations, but “it didn’t turn out to be what had been offered.”</p><p>For decades China has funneled billions of dollars into investment and infrastructure projects across Latin America. That investment has translated to rising power for China and a growing number of allies.</p><p>In Honduras, it has come in the form of construction of a hydroelectric dam project in central Honduras built by the Chinese company SINOHYDRO with about $300 million in Chinese government financing.</p><p>Honduras is the ninth diplomatic ally that Taipei has lost to Beijing since the pro-independence Tsai first took office in May 2016.</p><p>Taiwan still has ties with Belize, Paraguay and Guatemala in Latin America, and Vatican City. Most of its remaining partners are island nations in the Caribbean and South Pacific, along with Eswatini in southern Africa.</p><p>Some of these diplomatic recognitions were earned through Taiwan's financial and technical aid in the 1980s and '90s following its exceptional economic growth, Lorenzo Maggiorelli, a professor at the political science and international relations department of Jorge Tadeo Lozano University in Bogotá, Colombia, wrote in his research. </p><p>In 1998, Taiwan set up a $240 million aid fund for its Central American allies in a hope of retaining their support. Taiwanese businesses were also encouraged to invest in Central America to consolidate political ties, Maggiorelli wrote. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-taiwan-president-us-visit-china-81cb55bce5fdbbdb0535b6b4129fa514">Tsai is set to begin a 10-day trip</a> on Wednesday with visits to Guatemala and Belize. Her delegation will also stop in New York and Los Angeles, Lin said last week. Taiwan's Vice Foreign Minister Alexander Yui earlier said the purpose of Tsai's trip is to highlight the island's friendship with the two Latin American countries.</p><p>Wu said he did not have any evidence that the timing of the announcement was related to Tsai's trip but noted “China seems to be doing this intentionally.”</p><p>Despite China’s campaign of isolation, Taiwan retains robust informal ties with more than 100 other countries, most importantly the United States. The U.S. doesn’t have diplomatic relations with Taiwan but has maintained that Taipei is an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.</p>]]></description>

His press office later confirmed that the trip had been canceled.</p><p>Chinese authorities have been informed, “with the reiteration of the desire to schedule the visit on a new date,” the palace said.</p><p>Lula had been expected to leave for China on a multi-day visit on Friday or Saturday, but the trip was pushed back on Friday.</p><p>A delegation composed of ministers, senators, lawmakers and hundreds of businessmen - including more than 100 from the agricultural sector - had been set to accompany Lula during his first state visit to Brazil’s biggest trade partner since taking office in January.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="4e221f98400fce5c0147e7e0aa251856">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The trip’s cancellation is “bad news” for the government as the visit was “an opportunity for Lula to reconnect with business elites, especially in the agribusiness, who have been very much pro-Bolsonaro,” said Oliver Stuenkel, a political scientist from the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank.</p><p>The Brazilian president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping were scheduled to meet next Tuesday. Trade, investment and climate change were on the agenda and 20 bilateral agreements had been expected to be signed, according to a statement Thursday from the presidential palace.</p><p>Lula, who rarely postpones or cancels trips due to health reasons, traveled to Argentina in January and the U.S. in February, marking a departure from Brazil’s foreign policy under former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who showed little interest in international affairs or travel abroad.</p><p>The cancellation “will raise questions about to what extent Lula can sustain the very intense diplomatic activism” seen in the first three months of his presidency, Stuenkel said.</p><p>Pedro Brites, an international relations expert at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, said the postponement of the trip was a lost opportunity to switch the focus to more positive issues for the government “after a turbulent week.”</p><p>On Wednesday, federal police cracked down on a gang accused of plotting assassinations and kidnappings of public officials including Sen. Sergio Moro, who was the lead judge in the Carwash trials which led to the arrest of prominent politicians including Lula.</p><p>The then-former president spent over a year in jail before his conviction was annulled. In 2019, Moro became Bolsonaro’s Justice Minister.</p><p>The leftist leader on Thursday suggested the police operation was a setup by Moro, prompting fierce criticism by opposition politicians and discomfort among allies.</p><p>Rescheduling Lula’s visit to China will be a challenge due to the very crowded agendas of both leaders, said Stuenkel, but he predicted Lula “will really try to make this happen during the first half of the year” due to the high domestic and international importance of the trip.</p><p>Lula had been intending to normalize and strengthen ties with China after a rocky period of tensions under former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro.</p><p>Commercial ties continued but political relations with China soured during Bolsonaro’s term -- a particular low point came when Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo blamed the COVID-19 pandemic on the Chinese Communist Party in March 2020.</p>]]></description>

(AP) — Recent moves by President Joe Biden to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-tiktok-ban-china-17dc11399ffed22482ed6803c80b54c3">pressure TikTok over its Chinese ownership</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/alaska-oil-biden-willow-drilling-climate-24f135580259b9f9b245383dba921fe7">approve oil drilling in an untapped area of Alaska</a> are testing the loyalty of young voters, a group that’s largely been in his corner.</p><p>Youth turnout surged in the three elections since Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, helping Biden eke out victories in swing states in 2020, pick up a Democratic Senate seat in the 2022 election and stem potential losses in the House.</p><p>But the 80-year-old president has never been the favorite candidate of young liberals itching for a new generation of American leadership. As Biden gears up for an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-us-republican-party-democratic-b6a4d89a5629e768e92485067a220797">expected reelection campaign</a>, a potential <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew-security-risk-cc36f36801d84fc0652112fa461ef140">TikTok ban</a> and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/alaska-oil-drilling-biden-environment-climate-c39147c8ae1797aab9cb27219bf92675">Alaska drilling</a> could weigh him down. </p><p>Meanwhile, his plan to wipe out billions of dollars in student loan debt is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court-hearing-2128da75fc27ff3bcc0c3804ebd98aa7">in jeopardy at the Supreme Court</a>. The effort, announced shortly before last year’s midterms, was an attempt by Biden to keep a promise he made after defeating progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary campaign in 2020. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The risk for Biden is less that young left-of-center voters will vote Republican and more that they would sit out an uninspiring election altogether. </p><div id="afs:Card:530404428163" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="ced25e724ea71d8dba8f78de18901093">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“I’m a Democrat, but I’m not voting for Biden,” said Mark Buehlmann, a 20-year-old Arizona State University student who said he likely would abstain if Biden is the Democratic nominee, as expected. “He’s maybe capable of doing a good job, but he’s not capable of gathering the troops, rallying the people. Especially the Democratic voter base. I don’t think he’s a strong candidate.”</p><p>TikTok allows users, 150 million of whom are in the United States, to post short, creative videos for friends and strangers. Its algorithm has an uncanny ability to figure out what interests its users and serve up videos they’ll enjoy. It’s become a supremely popular — some say addictive — place for young people to find entertainment and community.</p><p>Western governments are growing increasingly worried that TikTok’s owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, might give browsing history or other data about users to China’s government or promote propaganda and disinformation. The U.S. and other nations have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-united-states-government-ap-top-news-business-95491774cf8f0fe3e2b9634658a22e56">banned TikTok from government-owned devices</a>, as have several states. </p><p>The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, part of Biden's Treasury Department, has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-tiktok-ban-china-17dc11399ffed22482ed6803c80b54c3">threatened to ban TikTok</a> if ByteDance doesn't sell its stake in the app, according to a Wall Street Journal report this month.</p><p>Trump tried to ban TikTok in 2020, but the move was blocked in court and later rescinded when Biden took office and ordered an in-depth study of the issue.</p><p>ByteDance says it's working to address security concerns and has plans to route traffic through servers owned by Oracle, a Silicon Valley-based tech company.</p><p>Biden administration officials insist that political concerns aren’t weighing into the national security review underway, but they’re also not blind to it.</p><p>Both political parties have reoriented around staking out tougher economic and security positions on China’s rise, and Biden has come under increasing pressure from GOP lawmakers to take action against TikTok.</p><p>In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo offered hyperbolically, “The politician in me thinks you’re going to literally lose every voter under 35, forever.”</p><p>But it’s clear that the Biden White House and his likely reelection campaign are keenly aware of the app’s massive domestic reach and demographic skew toward Democratic-leaning younger voters.</p><p>Highlighting Biden's balancing act, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a progressive New York Democrat popular on the left, held a news conference this past week with TikTok creators who have built popular and profitable channels on the social network “in support of free expression.”</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-ceo-congressional-hearing-bytedance-china-44d948c5b0ba18e2a714e0fa62d52779">Lawmakers grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi</a> Chew for nearly six hours Thursday over data security and harmful content. They responded skeptically during a tense House committee hearing to his assurances that the app prioritizes user safety and should not be banned due to its Chinese connections.</p><p>“Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said.</p><p>In interviews at Arizona State, one of the largest college campuses in the U.S. and a contributor to Biden's narrow 10,000-vote win in the swing state, young people described a TikTok ban as somewhere between an annoyance and an inevitability — but not something that would change their views of the president. </p><p>“Most people don’t really think about those kinds of things,” Lucas Vittor, a 19-year-old business administration student from Houston, said of a TikTok ban. “I think that they’ll probably just see it as, ‘He’s an oppressive leader, an old dude, he doesn’t know about social media.’”</p><p>If TikTok disappears, another app will emerge to capture the attention of young people, Vittor predicted. Other social media platforms, including YouTube and Instagram, have incorporated similar algorithm-driven video features, though some find them clunky compared with TikTok. </p><p>“It's not really Biden's issue,” said Ginny Xu, a 20-year-old chemical engineering student from Goodyear, Arizona. “It's more of a bipartisan thing — ‘safety’ from China."</p><p>Losing access to TikTok would be disappointing, Xu said, but it wouldn't dissuade her from voting for Biden if there's no better Democratic choice.</p><p>Her friend, 20-year-old chemical engineering student Maddie Bruce, agreed. </p><p>“I just am not a big Joe Biden fan,” Bruce said. She would prefer to see another Democrat run, but she would still vote for Biden, she said. </p><p>Forcing TikTok’s Chinese parent to sell its stake in the U.S. company could provide a convenient middle ground: minimizing the national security threat while avoiding having access to the app cut off for tens of millions of users.</p><p>The young have never voted at the same rates as their parents and grandparents, but their participation has ticked up markedly since the start of the Trump presidency.</p><p>The 2018 and 2022 midterms brought the highest levels of youth turnout of the past three decades, according to the Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, which studies young voters.</p><p>And when they do vote, young people vote overwhelmingly for Democrats.</p><p>Biden won 63% of voters age 18 to 24, compared with 34% for Trump, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of the electorate. Republican House candidates did better with young voters in last year’s midterms, but Democrats still had a 14-percentage point advantage, winning voters 24 and younger 54% to 40%. </p><p>“If Democrats are looking for their secret weapon, young voters are it,” said Jack Lobel, spokesperson for Voters of Tomorrow, which organizes young voters online and in person. “For Democrats especially, who already have young voters basically on their side, we are the untapped potential that campaigns are looking for.”</p><p>A TikTok ban might irritate a lot of young voters, but Biden can point to a strong record of standing up for young people’s interests, Lobel said.</p><p>Biden has tried to offer relief from student loan debt and has advocated for abortion rights. He signed a massive <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-signs-climate-health-bill-9a7f349fa7b07387d20ad603f2ff4875">climate spending bill</a> along with the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-signs-gun-violence-bill-c21249287f976c2c164d8753205c2e6d">most sweeping gun violence bill</a> in decades. </p><p>Marisol Ortega, a 21-year-old journalism student from Glendale, Arizona, said many of her peers are looking for someone younger and more exciting, even if they'll likely hold their nose and vote for him.</p><p>“Joe Biden has been a name in American politics for a very, very long time," Ortega said. “I think people are just kind of ready for something new.”</p><p>Still, the Biden administration irked environmentalists and young people by approving the huge Willow oil drilling project on Alaska's North Slope.</p><p>Young activists have been particularly active in pushing to drastically reduce oil drilling and move away from reliance fossil fuels. Before the president's decision, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/alaska-oil-biden-tiktok-willow-climate-conocophillips-0d6837053e703fa3b3c7084646e7d5d9">a #StopWillow campaign</a> garnered millions of views on TikTok urging Biden to block the project. </p><p>“He has delivered a lot for young people, and that’s why our advice to the administration was, ‘This is not the right direction to head on this issue,’” said Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, president of NextGen America, a youth organizing group. </p><p>___</p><p>AP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.</p><p>__</p><p>This story was first published on March 25, 2023. It was updated on March 27, 2023, to correct that the 2018 and 2022 midterms, not 2020, brought the highest levels of youth turnout of the past three decades.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>OTTAWA, ONTARIO (AP) — President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday celebrated the close, “inseparable” U.S.-Canada relationship and vowed that the two nations remain committed to defending Ukraine as it tries to repel a Russian invasion that has no end in sight.</p><p>Biden and Trudeau met just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks for the first time since the start of the war. The Chinese and Russian leader agreed to deepen economic bonds between their two countries. But Biden argued that Western resolve remains stronger and warned Russia that the U.S., Canada and their allies would defend “every inch of NATO territory."</p><p>The president also bristled at the notion that Russia has managed to expand a partnership with Beijing that is allowing Moscow to sustain its economy and war effort despite the U.S. lining up an international coalition to economically isolate Russia with a barrage of sanctions. China, however, thus far has refrained from providing Russia weapons since the start of the war, according to the White House.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“We have significantly expanded our alliances,” Biden said with Trudeau by his side during a joint news conference. “Tell me how in fact you see a circumstance where China has made a significant commitment to Russia? What commitment can they make?”</p><div id="afs:Card:530404428163" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="e2ae941b80fa0268eaa5ee2a89bd5073">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>At an earlier appearance with Biden before the Canadian Parliament, Trudeau said his country — which has provided Kyiv with artillery, ammunition, armor and tanks — remained committed to Ukraine's cause.</p><p>"As you well know, Mr. President, Canada will continue to stand strong with Ukraine, with whatever it takes," Trudeau said.</p><p>The whirlwind visit by Biden — his first visit to Canada as president — was meant to showcase U.S.-Canada ties, and both leaders offered full praise of each other.</p><p>Biden, addressing Canada's Parliament, even said the U.S. was “lucky” to have Canada as its neighbor as both countries grapple with the rapidly changing global economy, climate change, war in Europe and more.</p><p>“Today our destinies are intertwined and they are inseparable," Biden said. "Not because of inevitability of geography, but because it’s a choice, the choice we made again and again.”</p><p>“Two people, two countries, in my view sharing one heart.”</p><p>On one often-difficult subject, immigration, Biden and Trudeau used the visit to announce an agreement aiming to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-border-migrants-asylum-biden-trudeau-275d932944f831dc5c53d2d582f9ac45">stem the flow of asylum seekers</a> at unofficial border crossings from the U.S. to Canada.</p><p>The accord eliminates a loophole under existing rules and will allow both countries to turn away asylum seekers at their borders. At the same time, Canada announced that 15,000 migrants from the Western Hemisphere will be given official slots to apply to enter the country.</p><p>The leaders also sat down with top aides for a private conversation. Besides Ukraine and defense spending, the wide-ranging talks touched on shared concerns about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-ceo-congressional-hearing-bytedance-china-44d948c5b0ba18e2a714e0fa62d52779">China's aggressiveness</a> and violence and political instability in Haiti.</p><p>Trudeau noted Beijing’s growing economic power and a need for the U.S. and Canada to work together to address it. To that end, Canada said Friday it was entering an arrangement with IBM to expand domestic research and development and advanced packaging of semiconductors — and planning an investment of up to $250 million to "improve North American competitiveness and supply chain resiliency, help cut pollution, foster economic and national security.”</p><p>Trudeau also spoke of a need to coordinate even more closely to combat climate change and grow both countries' economies.</p><p>“We have to stick together,” Trudeau said. “We have to continue to face down authoritarian threats, both at home and abroad. We have to continue to defend what is right. This is not the time to compromise on our values.”</p><p>At their joint news conference later, Biden briefly veered away the day's themes to send a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-military-syria-iran-db9ac72843a0a71c995d6ea04392cdbf">warning to Tehran</a>, after a suspected Iranian-made drone on Thursday killed a U.S. contractor and wounded six other Americans in northeast Syria. </p><p>U.S. forces responded to the attack with airstrikes on sites in Syria used by groups affiliated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. Activists said the U.S. bombing killed at least four people.</p><p>“The United States does not, does not seek conflict with Iran,” Biden said. But he said Iran and its proxies should be prepared for the U.S. “to act forcefully to protect our people.”</p><p>The subject of difficult relations with China was an undercurrent of Biden's visit.</p><p>Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-ceo-congressional-hearing-bytedance-china-44d948c5b0ba18e2a714e0fa62d52779">arrested in China in 2018</a>, were in the balcony for the speeches in Parliament. </p><p>The two were taken into custody shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, technology company Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company’s founder, on a U.S. extradition request. The Canadians were held for more than than two years in China before the Biden and Trudeau governments managed to win their release. Kovrig is a former diplomat, Spavor a businessman.</p><p>Regarding Haiti, Canada is being nudged by the U.S. and other allies to lead an international mission there to deal with the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis. Canada on Friday announced $100 million ($72.7 million U.S.) in new aid for support and equipment for the Haitian National Police.</p><p>Biden said the idea of deploying an international force was “not in play at the moment” but had not been taken off the table. Trudeau said the international community can have the most impact in the long term by being "there to support the capacity of the police in Haiti.”</p><p>Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry and the country’s Council of Ministers sent an urgent appeal last October calling for “the immediate deployment of a specialized armed force, in sufficient quantity” to stop the crisis caused partly by the “criminal actions of armed gangs.” But more than five months later, no countries have stepped forward. Canada’s top military official has suggested the country doesn’t have the capacity.</p><p>Biden endorsed Trudeau's efforts to focus on capacity building but also noted the situation in Haiti remains fragile as “gangs have essentially taken the place of the government.” </p><p>“It’s a work in progress,” he said.</p><p>Friday's meetings also included discussion of defense spending, an issue that's in the spotlight after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon that traversed part of Canada and the continental U.S. last month.</p><p>Canada has long faced calls to increase its defense spending to 2% of its gross domestic product, the agreed-upon target by NATO members. Ottawa spends about 1.2% now.</p><p>"Canada and the United States share a responsibility and a commitment to make sure NATO can deter any threat and defend against any aggression from anyone," Biden said. “That’s the bedrock of the security of both our nations.”</p><p>The Trudeau government also announced plans for a $7.3 billion ($5.3 billion U.S.) project to upgrade and build infrastructure to support the arrival of a new fleet of F-35 fighter jets.</p><p>Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, closed the visit Friday night with a gala dinner in honor of Biden and first lady Jill Biden.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BEIJING (AP) — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-ceo-congressional-hearing-bytedance-china-44d948c5b0ba18e2a714e0fa62d52779">U.S. lawmakers have grilled</a> TikTok CEO <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-shou-zi-chew-testify-7927b1915db270aac67ca6f4ca31d6f3">Shou Zi Chew</a> about data security and harmful content, with some pushing to ban the popular short-video app nationwide.</p><p>Chew, a native of Singapore, told the lawmakers that TikTok prioritizes user safety as he sought to avert a U.S. ban on the app by downplaying its ties to China. </p><p>Both Republican and Democratic representatives aggressively questioned Chew on topics including TikTok’s content moderation practices, its data security plans, and past spying on journalists.</p><p>Here's a look at some of the concerns about TikTok and its ownership.</p><h2>WHY DOES WASHINGTON SAY TIKTOK IS A THREAT?</h2><p>TikTok, which has over 150 million American users, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd., which appoints its executives.</p><p>ByteDance is based in Beijing but registered in the Cayman Islands, as is common for privately owned Chinese companies. Its headquarters is in Beijing’s northwestern Haidian district, home to key universities and a hub for tech startups. TikTok has dual headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles. </p><p>Founded by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming in 2012, ByteDance is said to be valued at around $220 billion — nearly half of its 2021 valuation of $400 billion. Publicly traded Chinese tech companies and privately held ones like ByteDance have plunged in value since the ruling Communist Party tightened control over the industry with anti-monopoly and data security crackdowns.</p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" content-id="8d8a6a9694357040d484670b7f4833be" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew-security-risk-cc36f36801d84fc0652112fa461ef140">Western governments worry</a> Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over TikTok data on American users, exposing sensitive information. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Friday that China's government has never and will not ask companies to “collect or provide data, information or intelligence" held in foreign countries, adding the U.S. "has not provided any evidence so far to prove that TikTok threatens U.S. national security." </p><p>ByteDance says 60% of its shares are owned by non-Chinese investors such as U.S investment firms Carlyle Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Japan's SoftBank Group. Employees own 20% and its founders the remaining 20%. </p><p>Some details of the relationship between TikTok and ByteDance remain unclear to outsiders. </p><h2>WHAT CHINESE RULES WORRY WESTERN GOVERNMENTS?</h2><p>China's 2017 National Intelligence Law states that “any organization" must assist or cooperate with state intelligence work while a separate 2014 Counter-Espionage Law says “relevant organizations ... may not refuse" to collect evidence for an investigation. </p><p>Since ByteDance, which owns TikTok, is a Chinese company, it would likely have to abide by these rules if Chinese authorities asked it to turn over data.</p><p>Laws and regulations are only one aspect of the Communist Party’s pervasive control. There are no legal limits on the party’s powers. The authorities also can threaten to cancel licenses, conduct regulatory or tax investigations and use other penalties to compel compliance by Chinese and foreign companies operating in China. </p><p>The party sometimes conveys orders using “window guidance,” or informal communication in private. It has used crackdowns to tighten control over technology companies and force them to align with its goals. </p><p>The Chinese government has also sought more direct control over companies by getting seats on boards of directors.</p><h2>MUST TIKTOK TURN OVER DATA IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SAYS SO, EVEN WITH “ PROJECT TEXAS?” </h2><p>TikTok has promised to protect data on American users by storing it on servers operated by an outside contractor, Oracle Corp., in what’s known as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-us-news-business-ap-top-news-hong-kong-4eab38c608901de16e92facc1ed5debd">“Project Texas.”</a> Chew, the TikTok CEO, said all new U.S. user data is stored in the United States and the company should finish deleting older U.S. data from non-Oracle servers this year.</p><p>The fear is that ByteDance would have to hand over information it obtained from TikTok if ordered to do so by Chinese authorities, but Chew has said Project Texas will put U.S. data out of China's reach. </p><p>ByteDance disclosed in December that four employees gained access to data about reporters and people connected to them while looking for how information about the company was leaked. Chew told the lawmakers China-based ByteDance employees may still have access to some U.S. data but that won't be the case once Project Texas is complete.</p><p>In November, TikTok’s head of privacy for Europe said some employees in China had access to information about users in Britain and the European Union. </p><h2>DOES THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON BYTEDANCE?</h2><p>In Thursday’s hearing, lawmakers repeatedly tried to pin down Chew on whether ByteDance had links to China’s communist rulers.</p><p>He deflected questions about whether staff and top executives are Communist Party members.</p><p>“I do know that the founder himself is not a member of the Communist Party, but we don’t know the political affiliation of our employees because that’s not something we ask,” Chew said.</p><p>When questioned whether ByteDance was effectively controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, Chew said he disagreed.</p><p>After a lawmaker said the Communist Party holds a “golden share” in ByteDance that allows it to control one ByteDance board seat, Chew said, “That’s not correct.” </p><p>In China, so-called golden shares held by official investment funds are one way for Beijing to gain more oversight over business by giving them a 1% stake in companies. </p><p>Chew pushed back when lawmakers claimed that the Communist Party owns shares in ByteDance that give it a vote in how the company is run. “The Communist Party doesn’t have voting rights in ByteDance,” Chew said. </p><p>ByteDance’s main Chinese subsidiary is the license-holder for some of its video and information platforms that only serve the China market. </p><h2>WHAT IS DOUYIN AND WHAT IS TIKTOK'S RELATIONSHIP WITH IT?</h2><p>Douyin is ByteDance’s short-video platform for the China market. It's similar to TikTok, but its content is restricted by Chinese censorship rules that prohibit material deemed subversive or pornographic - a point emphasized by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/social-media-utah-kids-84bd1f6481071726327bce25cf3e7522">U.S. lawmakers worried</a> about harmful content viewed by young people. </p><p>The Communist Party’s extensive internet filters block most users in China from seeing TikTok. ByteDance has said TikTok has “no affiliation” with Beijing ByteDance Technology Co., the subsidiary that operates Douyin; Toutiao, a news and short-video platform, and other services.</p><h2>HOW DID CHINA REACT TO THE TIKTOK CEO'S WASHINGTON TESTIMONY?</h2><p>Most of the social media reaction in China was sympathetic to Chew, with praise for how he handled the hostile questions lobbed at him.</p><p>Comments on Douyin and microblogging platform Weibo were critical of U.S. lawmakers for asking Chew leading or “trap” questions. Many commenters used a Chinese saying that means “If you want to accuse someone, there's always a way."</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

Chinese prosecutors have wide powers to hold suspects for lengthy interrogations if state secrets are believed to be involved. </p><p>The announcements come barely a month after the head of China’s national soccer body Chen Xuyuan was arrested on corruption charges. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Chen was head of the Chinese Football Association and vice chair of its party committee, underscoring the government’s heavy hand in attempting to direct success in the game. </p><p>China’s increasingly autocratic president and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping declared a plan to make China a football superpower, but funding and enthusiasm have appeared to dwindle. Xi has also made fighting corruption a signature policy, taking down political rivals in the process and further embedding strict policies governing freedom of speech and civil society organizations outside party control. </p><div id="afs:Card:875733071197" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="7e3050caddcba73bb58abda3c84ee0ee">Hub peek embed (Soccer) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Sports falls under the same yoke of state control and the national team has seen a revolving door of foreign and domestic managers cut loose for their failure to produce results. </p><p>One of China's most decorated past football leaders, former Everton and Sheffield United midfielder Li Tie, has been jailed amid a graft investigation. </p><p>Despite its success in Olympic sports such as table tennis and shooting, China has only qualified for one soccer World Cup, more than two decades ago. The men's national team is currently ranked 80th by FIFA, just behind countries such as Uzbekistan, Georgia and Gabon. </p><p>China’s top division clubs once paid big salaries to attract foreign talent, but the league has virtually collapsed under the now-abandoned “zero-COVID” policy and lingering economic malaise. Top sponsors have gone bankrupt and and efforts to fight match-fixing and other forms of cheating have received little attention of late. </p><p>___</p><p>More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</p>]]></description>

(Francis Malasig/Pool Photo via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Filipino diplomats confronted Chinese officials in closed-door talks Friday with a slew of protests over China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, including targeting a Philippine coast guard ship with a military-grade laser, but no resolution was reached on the issues, an official said.</p><p>Territorial disputes in the busy waterway have long loomed as a potential flashpoint in Asia and have become a sensitive front in the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-china-destroyer-south-china-sea-5f761c49179f622b8c296885c46a2a80">regional rivalry between China and the United States</a>.</p><p>Washington lays no claims in the contested waters but has challenged Beijing's extensive claims, including by deploying its warships and fighter jets and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-manila-philippines-china-0d7b13493ce6c304af276c02365558df">repeatedly warning that it would help defend the Philippines</a> — a treaty ally — if Philippine forces, ships and aircraft are attacked. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims in the seaway, which sits atop vast deposits of oil and gas.</p><p>A Chinese delegation led by Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong held two days of talks starting Thursday with Philippine counterparts led by Foreign Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro and reviewed overall relations. The two sides focused on their territorial disputes Friday, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said.</p><div id="afs:Card:251708568337" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="70ea7983dbf67b1f9ae5264c6ce9271a">Hub peek embed (apf-asiapac) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The talks opened with both sides citing an agreement between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who made a state visit to China in early January, to manage the territorial conflicts amicably while enhancing economic ties and other aspects of a nearly half-century of diplomatic relations.</p><p>“We should not allow specific differences to define our bilateral relations or allow certain disputes to stand in the way of overall cooperation,” Sun said in an opening speech before journalists were asked to leave the meeting room.</p><p>A Philippine official involved in the talks told The Associated Press that Filipino diplomats outlined several incidents underscoring China's assertiveness in the disputed waters in the closed-door talks. They cited Chinese “incursions” and a Feb. 6 incident when a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-philippines-government-manila-china-8ee5459dcac872b14a49c4a428029259">Chinese coast guard ship aimed a military-grade laser</a> that briefly blinded some crew members of a Philippine patrol vessel off a disputed shoal, the official said.</p><p>China's representatives responded mostly by reiterating Beijing's claim of sovereignty in most of the South China Sea and citing intrusions by Philippine vessels, the official said.</p><p>A Philippine foreign affairs department statement said both sides discussed “different incidents at sea” since 2021, when the last talks on the disputes were held, but it did not mention any resolution. Proposed steps to boost cooperation were discussed, such as establishing a joint coast guard committee and holding annual defense security talks, it said.</p><p>The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to publicly discuss what transpired in the meetings.</p><p>Marcos summoned the Chinese ambassador to Manila to express concern shortly after the laser-pointing incident. The Philippine coast guard caught the incident on video, which it made public, but Beijing countered that the Philippine vessel intruded into Chinese territorial waters and that its coast guard used a harmless laser gadget to monitor the vessel’s movement.</p><p>Manila's foreign affairs department condemned the Chinese coast guard’s action and sent a strongly worded protest to the Chinese Embassy. More than 200 such diplomatic protests have been lodged by the Philippines against China since last year, including at least 77 since Marcos took office in June, underlining how the longstanding conflicts have become a major irritant in relations with China early in his presidency.</p><p>China and the Philippines first held talks focusing on the disputes in 2017, but no major resolution has been reached as both sides stuck to their territorial stance. The consultations, nevertheless, help both sides understand each other's position better “and make accidental crises a bit less likely,” said Washington-based analyst Greg Poling, who has studied the conflicts extensively.</p><p>“It has to be done with clear eyes and no expectation that the fundamental issues will be solved in the short term through that format,” Poling told the AP. “China is not interested in compromise and the positions of the two countries are not reconcilable.”</p><p>In early February, the Marcos administration announced it would allow rotating batches of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-district-of-columbia-lloyd-austin-philippines-china-5a7e51e66e71566ce93e0849b94efc26">American forces to indefinitely station in four more Philippine military camps</a>. Those are in addition to five local bases earlier designated under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement between the allies.</p><p>Marcos told reporters Wednesday the four additional military sites would include areas in the northern Philippines. That location has infuriated Chinese officials because it would provide U.S. forces a staging ground close to southern China and Taiwan.</p><p>The Chinese diplomats expressed their <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-philippines-south-china-sea-us-military-c970a28cca98ff284347aad5c7aecf73">strong opposition to an expanded U.S. military presence</a> in the Philippines in closed-door talks on Thursday and warned of its future implications, the Philippine official told AP without elaborating.</p><p>The Filipino diplomats responded to China’s objections by saying an expanded American military presence serves their national interest and would boost Philippine capability to respond to natural disasters, the official said, suggesting the move was not aimed at targeting China.</p><p>Marcos said American forces would also be allowed to station in military areas on the western Philippine island province of Palawan, adding that the U.S. military presence would boost coastal defense.</p><p>Palawan faces the South China Sea, a key passage for global trade that Beijing claims virtually in its entirety.</p><p>___</p><p>Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific">https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Jeffrey Collins)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina's Republican-controlled Senate passed a bill Thursday that would bar citizens of “foreign adversary” nations from buying property in the state, an anti-espionage measure that critics fear will chill overseas investments over outsize concerns.</p><p><a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess125_2023-2024/bills/576.htm">The measure</a> approved Thursday by a 31-5 vote would apply to citizens of so-called adversarial countries on a U.S. Department of Commerce list that currently includes China, Russia, Cuba, Iran and North Korea.</p><p>The bill is one of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-grand-forks-wyoming-state-government-north-dakota-montana-3d6a2f9a1bb06ab40b18a08cbf7c175d">numerous like-minded measures</a> that have arisen across the country after a suspected Chinese spy balloon recently floated over U.S. territory and was brought down <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-state-government-united-states-us-news-myrtle-beach-cc07bd066880c847e8acc0d86cb396af">off the South Carolina coast</a>. The overflight fueled lawmakers' worries that nefarious actors may advance surveillance efforts under the guise of land ownership. At least 11 state legislatures are considering similar proposals.</p><p>The leading sponsor of the South Carolina bill, Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, said he was spurred to action by a Chinese biomedical company's pending $28 million purchase of 500 acres near the U.S. Army's Cyber Command headquarters in the state. He drew a parallel between some foreign land purchases and the Trojan Horse of Greek mythology. </p><div id="afs:Card:610860613396" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="158e23561036f15505775f9a81251ae5">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“We need to look inside that wooden horse before we let it in the gate. And there are some countries that have given us more of a reason to look inside the wooden horse before we let it in the gate,” Massey said. “These five have specifically given us reason to have more scrutiny and to be a little bit more concerned.”</p><p>Massey said the law would no longer apply to countries if they are removed from the federal list and could apply to any that are added to it. </p><p>Democratic Sen. Dick Harpootlian, who opposed the bill, questioned the premise that a Chinese company’s purchase of land equated to “establishing a nest of spies.” While acknowledging his distaste for the government in Beijing, he said the matter would better be left to federal officials.</p><p>“This is a bumper sticker,” Harpootlian said. “This is not legislation that is going to improve the quality of life for anybody in this state.”</p><p>Democratic Sen. Mike Fanning expressed concern that it could hamstring rural counties with fewer options for outside investment.</p><p>Massey acknowledged that some areas are desperate for economic development but said the listed countries have “earned additional scrutiny.”</p><p>The measure lets businesses operating in the state before 2023 acquire land for expansion with approval from the Secretary of Commerce and governor. Massey noted that it would not force current landowners to divest any property and only applies to future acquisitions.</p><p>It would also cover companies with partial “adversary” nation ownership. Citizens from such countries could not collectively hold more than a 20% stake in a landowning company, and no single individual could own over 10%.</p><p>Immigrants from those countries who hold permanent residency could acquire no more than 5 acres of land, and only for residential use.</p><p>During debate, Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto asked if someone with a green card, for example, could open a restaurant. Massey replied that such a person could do so but not own the building where it is housed. </p><p>“Why is that?” Hutto asked. “I thought the American Dream was kind of to own your own business?”</p><p>“Once they become a citizen, they could do that,” Massey said, adding: “They are still citizens of foreign adversaries.”</p><p>___</p><p>James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. <a href="https://www.reportforamerica.org/">Report for America</a> is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.</p>]]></description>

He says the company plans to store all U.S. user data on servers maintained and owned by the software giant Oracle.</p><p>Here's a closer look at Chew:</p><h2>WHAT IS HIS BACKGROUND?</h2><p>Chew, 40, is a native of Singapore, where he lives with his wife, Vivian Kao, and their two children. He graduated in 2006 from University College London and worked for two years at Goldman Sachs before moving to the U.S. to pursue a master's degree at Harvard Business School. Chew had a two-year internship with Facebook.</p><p>After earning his MBA, he became a partner at venture capital firm DST Global, where he worked for five years and helped facilitate investment in the company that became ByteDance. He then worked for five years at Xiaomi, a Chinese smartphone company, before being appointed TikTok CEO in 2021, replacing Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive. Chew reports to ByteDance CEO Liang Rubo.</p><h2>WHAT'S HIS REPUTATION?</h2><p>The U.S. public knows relatively little about Chew compared with Silicon Valley social media giants such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, said Brooke Erin Duffy, who studies social media platforms as an associate professor of communications at Cornell University. </p><p>“Chew has been in the background on public discourse until now, so he doesn't have the same reputation we would associate with the Silicon Valley set, especially Zuckerberg,” Duffy said.</p><p>Most Americans likely first heard of Chew when he released a video this week speaking directly to TikTok's U.S. users, she said, "so he doesn't have the same reputation as someone we know, and (we) don't have sense of who he is.”</p><p>But Chew is well-respected within the U.S. and China tech communities, and was considered a good fit for TikTok because of his background in investment banking and his time at Facebook and DST Global, said Dan Ives, managing director of New York-based Wedbush Securities.</p><p>“He gained a lot of respect just by taking that high risk, in-the-hot seat role at TikTok,” Ives said, adding that the company likely thought he was the right person to ease tensions with U.S. lawmakers.</p><div id="afs:Card:340032654111" content-id="7927b1915db270aac67ca6f4ca31d6f3" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout </div><h2>HOW DID HE DO IN HIS TESTIMONY?</h2><p>Chew's decision to emphasize TikTok's reach in the U.S. might have backfired, and “actually strengthened U.S. lawmakers’ argument that TikTok poses a threat to both national security and young people,” said Jasmine Enberg, a social media analyst at Insider Intelligence.</p><p>Enberg said there was little Chew could say to convince lawmakers that TikTok is not monitored or influenced in some way by the Chinese government.</p><p>Ives said Chew's testimony was always going to be fraught, but his lack of concrete answers about data access and security was “a disaster” and likely set the stage for a ban.</p><p>“It was a perfect storm and lawmakers were ready,” Ives said.</p><p>But Shelly Palmer, a professor of advanced media at Syracuse University who studies social network business models, said Chew did the best he could given the grilling he received from lawmakers who “in my opinion were not actually listening" but instead were grandstanding. </p><p>“I don't think he has the ability, because of who he is and what he does, to be satisfying to this audience,” said Palmer, adding that he believed Chew's answers were not unlike those given by CEOs from U.S.-based social media companies who have been questioned in the past about privacy. </p><p>___</p><p>Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.

This hearing is to focus on the Chinese government's treatment of its Uyghur population. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Two women who experienced life in Chinese “reeducation” camps for Uyghurs told lawmakers Thursday of lives under imprisonment and surveillance, rape and torture as a special House committee focused on countering China shined a light on human rights abuses in the country.</p><p>Qelbinur Sidik, a member of China's ethnic Uzbek minority who was forced to teach Chinese in separate detention facilities for Uyghur men and women, told lawmakers of male Uyghur detainees held chained and shackled in cells so tiny they had to crawl out when authorities summoned them. “They were called by numbers for interrogations. And then you would hear horrible screaming sounds from torture,” she said.</p><p>Innocent female Uyghur detainees were held by the thousands, heads shaved, in gray uniforms, Sidik said. Guards tortured the women by electric shocks and by gang rape, sometimes combining both. </p><p>Reeducation camps intended to drain the Uyghur inmates of their language, religious beliefs and customs forced men and women into “11 hours of brainwashing lessons on a daily basis,” testified Gulbahar Haitiwaji, a Uyghur who spent more than two years in two reeducation camps and police stations. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Before eating, we have to praise them, say that we are grateful ... for China's Communist Party and we are grateful for (President) Xi Jinping,” Haitiwaji said. “And after, to finish eating, we have to praise them again.”</p><div id="afs:Card:610860613396" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="833fb8f337b3a87fcdf0b760bb3e7066">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Accused of “disorder” and detained with 30 to 40 people in a cell meant for nine, the Uyghur woman said, she and other female detainees were chained to their beds for 20 days at one point. </p><p>Detention left her gaunt. Freed and sent to France thanks to a pressure campaign by her family there in 2019, she was given more food by Chinese authorities before her release, so her appearance would not speak of her mistreatment.</p><p>In parting, Chinese officials warned Haitiwaji that “whatever I had witnessed in the concentration camp I should not talk about it,” she said. “If I do, they will retaliate against my family back home.”</p><p>The U.S. and many other governments, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-japan-crime-geneva-72426c36d1a4c0ae83d9520d2f19d840">the United Nations</a>, and human rights groups accuse China of sweeping a million or more people from its Uyghur community and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups into detention camps, where many have said they were tortured, sexually assaulted, and forced to abandon their language and religion. China <a href="https://apnews.com/article/asia-pacific-technology-f6ffda9288b1671da741c07d8f4f8afc">denies the accusations</a>, which are based on evidence including interviews with survivors and photos and satellite images from Uyghur's home province of Xinjiang, a major hub for factories and farms in far western China.</p><p>The accusations also include <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-international-news-weekend-reads-china-health-269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c">draconian birth control policies</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-beijing-ap-top-news-international-news-asia-pacific-890b79866c9eb1451ddf67b121272ee2">all-encompassing restrictions</a> on people’s movement and forced labor.</p><p>“For a long time, some U.S. politicians have repeatedly used Xinjiang-related issues to stir up rumors and engage in political manipulation under the pretext of human rights, in an attempt to tarnish China’s image and curb China’s development,” said Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington.</p><p>The Chinese government's actions in Xinjiang were about “countering violence, terrorism, radicalization and separatism,” the embassy spokesman insisted. </p><p>The early focus on the plight of Uyghurs by the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party is designed to show the Chinese government's true nature, said Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the committee's Republican chairman.</p><p>“They are the first-hand witnesses to the systemic, unimaginable brutality, witnesses to the attempted elimination of a people, a culture, a civilization,” Gallagher said Thursday.</p><p>Between 1 million to 2 million members of China’s Uyghur minority have been held in mass internment centers, said Adrian Zenz, a researcher on the Xinjiang camps at the Washington-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. More exact estimates are not possible, given China’s concealment, Zenz said.</p><p>Expert witnesses praised U.S. actions, including passage of a bill on forced labor and the levying of penalties on companies shown to be using the forced labor of Uyghurs. They denounced businesses and investors still profiting from suspect supply chains and possibly complicit Chinese enterprises there.</p><p>Nury Turkel, chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and a Uyghur-American, said crimes against humanity cannot be treated merely as an area of disagreement or an irritant in a bilateral relationship. “Genocide is defined as an international crime for a reason,” Turkel said. “Confronting is not an option," it's a necessity, he said.</p><p>Chinese technology is enabling and facilitating total control and collective punishment of vulnerable populations, Turkel said.</p><p>And Naomi Kikoler, director of the Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide, which is affiliated with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, urged the U.S. to start working with allies in a more comprehensive way to confront China on the abuses in Xinjiang.</p><p>“The United States alone cannot prevent these crimes,” Kikoler said. “We must work with other governments, Uyghur civil society and the private sector to develop a swift, coordinated and global strategy to protect the Uyghur community. Thus far no such strategy exists.”</p><p>The hearing comes following Chinese President Xi's <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-china-xi-putin-meeting-d989e5c65ff762c1af91215d6dd2cf6e">trip to Russia</a> to show support for President Vladimir Putin, underscoring just how badly U.S. relations with China have deteriorated.</p><p>“What we're seeing here is increasingly a de facto alliance against America and our allies to try and undercut our interests,” Gallagher said.</p><p>The formation of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-china-us-republican-party-3772ee2a67ebe33a5e4527bf7de4d305">special China committee</a> this year was a top priority of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., but close to 150 Democrats also voted for the committee’s creation, and its work has been unusually bipartisan so far.</p><p>Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the ranking Democrat, said more needs to be done to protect the Uyghurs and the new committee can help lead the way. “Make no mistake, CCP leaders are absolutely listening to us closely this evening,” he said, adding: “Let's make sure the CCP hears us loud and clear. Their genocide must end.”</p><p>Haitiwaji, the ethnic Uyghur woman testifying before the committee, said she is speaking out because she feels an obligation to speak for those still languishing in detention centers. She called on lawmakers to follow the example of Canada, which has adopted a policy of accepting 10,000 Uyghur refugees from around the world. </p><p>“Please rescue Uyghur and other Turkic refugees, like Canada has done,” she said. “Please stop American companies from continuing to be complicit in surveilling our people and profiting from their labor.”</p>]]></description>

Mark Milley, right, accompanied by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, speaks during a briefing at the Pentagon in Washington, Wednesday, March 15, 2023. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)</p></figcaption></figure>      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military must be ready for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-china-beijing-lloyd-austin-government-and-politics-e4f36f6e8547f1d20dedd954976d2fb1">possible confrontation with China</a>, the Pentagon's leaders said Thursday, pushing Congress to approve the Defense Department's proposed $842 billion budget, which would modernize the force in Asia and around the world.</p><p>"This is a strategy-driven budget — and one driven by the seriousness of our strategic competition with the People’s Republic of China," Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in testimony before the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense. </p><p>Pointing to increases in new technology, such as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-japan-seoul-south-korea-lloyd-austin-43cd78f6ba607300e11c7e5bc0962a3c">hypersonics</a>, Austin said the budget proposes to spend more than $9 billion, a 40% increase over last year, to build up military capabilities in the Pacific and defend allies.</p><p>The testimony comes on the heels of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-china-putin-xi-ukraine-alliance-partnership-us-sanctions-beijing-moscow-9089f4d4b9c0d8bb259b706ffcf4b0f6">Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow</a>, which added to concerns that China will step up its support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine and increasingly threaten the West.</p><p>China's actions, said Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “are moving it down the path toward confrontation and potential conflict with its neighbors and possibly the United States.” He said deterring and preparing for war "is extraordinarily expensive, but it’s not as expensive as fighting a war. And this budget prevents war and prepares us to fight it if necessary.”</p><div id="afs:Card:610860613396" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="14a601ee94f10b76e1817d58b173a03a">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., pressed the defense leaders on Xi's meeting with Putin and its impact on U.S. competition with China, which he called “the elephant in the room.” The U.S., he said, is “at a crucial moment here."</p><p>The growing alliance between China and Russia, two nuclear powers, and Xi's overtures to Putin during the Ukraine war are “troubling,” Austin said.</p><p>He added that the U.S. had not yet seen China provide arms to Russia, but if it does, “it would prolong the conflict and certainly broaden the conflict potentially not only in the region but globally.”</p><p>Milley, who will retire later this year, said the Defense Department must continue to modernize its forces to ensure they will be ready to fight if needed. “It is incumbent upon us to make sure we remain No. 1 at all times” to be able to deter China, he said.</p><div id="b2931af4a907433888f863f77351cd25" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Two decades of war in Iraq and Afghanistan eroded the military’s equipment and troop readiness, so the U.S. has been working to replace weapons systems and give troops time to reset. It's paid off, Milley told Congress. </p><p>“Our operational readiness rates are higher now than they have been in many, many years,” Milley said. More than 60% of the active force is at the highest states of readiness right now and could deploy to combat in less than 30 days, while 10% could deploy within 96 hours, he said.</p><p>Milley cautioned that those gains would be lost if Congress can't pass a budget on time, because it will immediately affect training. </p><p>Members of the panel, including Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., also made it clear that while they support the ongoing U.S. assistance to Ukraine, “the days of blank checks are over.” And they questioned the administration’s ultimate goal there. </p><p>Milley said the intent is to make sure that Ukraine remains a free and independent country with its territory intact, maintaining global security and the world order that has existing since World War II. </p><p>“If that goes out the window,” he said, “we’ll be doubling our defense budgets at that point, because that will introduce not an era of great power competition, that will begin an era of great power conflict. And that will be extraordinarily dangerous for the whole world.”</p><p>The hearing was likely one of Milley's last in front of Congress. His four-year term as chairman — capping a 43-year military career — ends in October. While many members took the opportunity to thank him for those years of service, it was also an opportunity to press him on one of the darkest moments of his chairmanship — the loss of 13 service members to a suicide bomber at Abbey Gate during the chaotic American evacuation from Afghanistan. </p><p>Questions remain about the bombing, and Republicans have criticized President Joe Biden's decision to completely withdraw from Afghanistan in August 2021. During an intense two-week evacuation, which took place as Kabul fell to the Taliban, U.S. forces got more than 120,000 personnel out of the country, but paid a large price in the lives of U.S. service members and Afghans. The withdrawal also left behind many Afghans who worked with and supported U.S. troops during the war, and efforts to get them out continue. </p><p>“I can think of no greater tragedy than what happened at Abbey Gate. And I have yet to fully reconcile myself to that entire affair,” Milley told the panel members. He called the end state, which left the Taliban in control of the country, a strategic failure. </p><p>But that “did not happen in the last 19 days or even the last 19 months. That was a 20-year war,” Milley said. “There were decisions made all along the way which culminated in what the outcome was. And there’s many many lessons to be learned.”</p>]]></description>

Art Basel Hong Kong, a prominent art fair in Asia, began this week, alongside other art events.</p><p>Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to China’s rule in 1997, promising to retain its Western-style freedoms. The city was rocked by a massive pro-democracy protest movement in 2019, which ended after China imposed a “National Security Law” that criminalized much dissent. The city's government has since <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-europe-business-5a7f50d5d5027fda34f9addeb883e809">jailed and silenced</a> many activists.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Amadon said he had followed the protests in Hong Kong closely, and he wanted his work to show solidarity with the protesters and remind people about the new reality of the city.</p><div id="afs:Card:251708568337" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="956803ea3b5daf5c6ad8b68c55245c25">Hub peek embed (apf-asiapac) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“It was too much watching Art Week in Hong Kong pretend the Chinese government didn’t crush a democracy and turn Hong Kong into a vassal surveillance state... because it’s a convenient location for a good market,” the Los Angeles-based artist said. </p><p>Amadon said he knew the work would be controversial and was surprised it had been displayed in public for days. It featured a panning surveillance camera.</p><p>Flashes of Matrix-like text showcased the names and prison sentences of convicted activists and other prominent figures in the pro-democracy movement, including legal scholar Benny Tai and former student leader Joshua Wong, who were both charged with subversion in the biggest case brought under the National Security Law. </p><p>These details were shown too fast to be seen by the naked eyes Amadon said, but viewers could see the details if they used a camera to capture stills. It also referred to journalist-turned activist Gwyneth Ho who was assaulted when she was live-streaming a mob attack in July 2019 during the massive protests sparked by an extradition bill.</p><p>The gallery that arranged the exhibit did not know whether the government ordered the work taken down, Francesca Boffetti, CEO at Art Innovation Gallery said in an email.</p><p>“Our intermediary told us that the owners of SOGO were concerned about the sensitive political content hidden behind Patrick’s work, so they decided to remove the work from the exhibition immediately,” Boffetti said.</p><p>No one mentioned any law or threatened them with fines, she added, but SOGO’s legal team asked the gallery whether it was aware of the content and message of Amadon’s work.</p><p>Local police and SOGO did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau told the Associated Press that it did not contact SOGO.</p><p>Amadon said the gallery told him in an urgent call that it was very concerned about its legal exposure after a conversation with SOGO.</p><p>Since the passage of the National Security Law, the city’s art and media communities have learned to be wary of crossing vaguely defined red lines. Pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-europe-newspapers-business-97cf6aec4153c9201ae8cda679ff0e3d">forced to close</a> after authorities arrested its top editors and executives and accused them of foreign collusion. Some artists known for their political work left Hong Kong under the shadow of the law. Some filmmakers have stopped showing their work in the city. Even those producing non-political content have become cautious. But the government insisted that its residents continue to enjoy promised freedoms after the enactment of the law. </p><p>Amadon said what happened to his work showed that the city had lost its freedom of expression and artistic freedom.</p><p>“This objectively shows that they are no longer here in the same way that they once were,” he said. “From a narrative standpoint, I mean, it did have to get censored and taken down, I feel like, to be a completed piece.” </p><p>___</p><p>Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific">https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific</a></p>]]></description>

The Wall Street Journal reported U.S. authorities were considering banning TikTok ban if ByteDance doesn’t sell the company.</p><p>“If the news is true, China will resolutely oppose it,” said a Ministry of Commerce spokeswoman, Shu Jueting.

Honduras President Xiomara Castro announced last week that her government will seek to establish diplomatic relations with China, which would imply severing relations with Taiwan. </p><p>The switch would leave Taiwan recognized by only 13 countries, as China spends billions to win recognition for its “One China” policy.</p><p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin dismissed reports that Honduras switched relations after Taiwan declined requests to buy $2.5 billion in the country's sovereign debt. </p><p>“We welcome the Honduran government’s positive statement to develop relations with China.

In Latin America, it also has relations with Belize, Guatemala and Paraguay, with most of its remaining partners being island nations in the Caribbean and South Pacific, along with Eswatini in southern Africa. </p><p>Honduras would become the ninth diplomatic ally that Taipei has lost to Beijing since pro-independence President Tsai Ing-wen first took office in May 2016. She is due to step down next year at the end of her second term.</p><p>Despite China’s campaign of isolation, Taiwan retains robust informal ties with more than 100 other countries, most importantly the U.S.</p><p>__</p><p>AP writer Marlon González in Tegucigalpa, Honduras contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

The Filipino diplomats responded by saying the decision to allow an expanded American military presence was in their national interest and would boost Philippine capability to respond to natural disasters, the official said, suggesting it was not aimed at China. </p><p>Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong and Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro led the talks aimed at assessing overall relations between the two sides amid thorny issues, including Beijing’s alarm over a Philippine decision to allow the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-district-of-columbia-lloyd-austin-philippines-china-5a7e51e66e71566ce93e0849b94efc26">U.S. military to expand its presence</a> to a northern region facing the Taiwan Strait and escalating spats in the South China Sea.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The discussions on Friday will focus on the long-seething territorial spats in the disputed waterway, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila.</p><div id="afs:Card:251708568337" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="c970a28cca98ff284347aad5c7aecf73">Hub peek embed (apf-asiapac) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The back-to-back meetings are the first under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in June. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping in a state visit to Beijing in January, where both agreed to expand ties, pursue talks on potential joint oil and gas explorations and manage territorial disputes amicably.</p><p>In early February, the Marcos administration announced it would allow rotating batches of American forces to indefinitely station in four more Philippine military camps. Those are in addition to five local bases earlier designated under a 2014 defense pact between the longtime treaty allies.</p><p>Marcos said Wednesday the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/marcos-us-military-edca-china-c2fb22da58f940ce49f4502908dbb371">four new military sites would include areas in the northern Philippines</a>. That location has infuriated Chinese officials because it would provide U.S. forces a staging ground close to southern China and Taiwan.</p><p>The Americans would also have access to military areas on the western Philippine island province of Palawan, Marcos said, adding that the U.S. military presence under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement was aimed at boosting coastal defense.</p><p>Palawan faces the South China Sea, a key passage for global trade that Beijing claims virtually in its entirety but a United Nations-backed arbitration tribunal ruled in 2016 that historical claim had no legal basis under the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Seas.</p><p>China had dismissed the ruling, which Washington and other Western governments recognize, and continues to defy it.</p><p>When asked to react to the Philippine decision, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a news briefing Wednesday in Beijing that defense cooperation between countries “needs to be conducive to regional peace and stability and not targeted at or harmful to the interests of any third party.”</p><p>Wang warned countries in the region “to remain vigilant and avoid being coerced or used by the U.S.” without naming the Philippines.</p><p>A recent statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in Manila was more blunt and warned that the Manila government's security cooperation with Washington “will drag the Philippines into the abyss of geopolitical strife and damage its economic development at the end of the day.”</p><p>The territorial conflicts have persisted as a major irritant in relations early in the six-year term of Marcos, whose administration has filed at least 77 of more than 200 diplomatic protests by the Philippines against China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters since last year alone.</p><p>That included a Feb. 6 incident when a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-philippines-government-manila-china-8ee5459dcac872b14a49c4a428029259">Chinese coast guard ship aimed a military-grade laser</a> that briefly blinded some crew members of a Philippine patrol vessel off a disputed shoal. Marcos summoned the Chinese ambassador to Manila to express concern over the incident, but Beijing said the Philippine vessel intruded into Chinese territorial waters and its coast guard used a harmless laser gadget to monitor the vessel’s movement.</p><p>The Biden administration has been strengthening an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan. The U.S. moves dovetail with Philippine efforts to shore up its territorial defense amid its disputes with China in the South China Sea.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-china-destroyer-ship-paracel-south-china-sea-a146fa95de728afb0b3a9d8a49dceeb8">The U.S. denied Chinese claims</a> Thursday that its military had driven away an American guided-missile destroyer from operating around disputed islands in the South China Sea, with the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet saying in a statement the USS Milius was conducting routine operations in the waterway and was not expelled.</p><p>China’s Southern Theatre Command had earlier said it had forced the USS Milius away from waters around the Paracel Islands, which China calls Xisha, after it “illegally entered China’s Xisha territorial waters without approval from the Chinese government, undermining peace and stability in the South China Sea.”</p><p>Two senior Filipino officials told the AP that the Philippine government would extend the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, which allows the temporary presence of U.S. forces and their defense equipment in the country. The Philippine Constitution prohibits the permanent basing of foreign troops in the country and their involvement in local combat.</p><p>The agreement, signed in 2014, would initially be effective for 10 years and would remain in force automatically unless terminated by either side with a one-year advance written notice.</p><p>The two officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they lack authority to discuss the issue publicly.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalist Joeal Calupitan contributed.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Canada lawmaker quits Trudeau's party amid China allegations]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A lawmaker said late Wednesday that he is stepping down from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party after a media report raised questions about his dealings with China, a claim that comes amid an investigation into allegations of Chinese meddling in Canada's elections. </p><p>Member of Parliament Han Dong said the report quoting anonymous sources was an attack on his reputation and his loyalty to Canada. He said he will leave the Liberals and sit in Parliament as an independent lawmaker to avoid causing problems for the party. </p><p>Global News, citing unidentified security sources, published a report Wednesday alleging Dong suggested to China’s consul general in Toronto in 2021 that the opposition Conservative party would benefit if Beijing released two Canadians accused of espionage. Global did not give any direct quotes from the purported conversation.</p><p>Canadians Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur, were arrested in China in December 2018 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada into releasing Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies. She was arrested in Vancouver at the request of U.S. authorities. China, the U.S. and Canada completed a prisoner swap just over two years later.</p><div id="afs:Card:723795359432" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="e49480ed8101db398de842aadeec7477">Hub peek embed (apf-canada) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Dong, who has represented a Parliament district in Toronto since 2019, told Global News that he did speak with the diplomat but disputed how the conversation was characterized. </p><p>Dong gave a tearful party resignation speech in Parliament late Wednesday.</p><p>“Let me be clear: What has been reported is false, and I will defend myself against this absolutely untrue claim,” he said. Dong said he wanted to “assure Mr. Michael Spavor and Mr. Michael Kovrig and their families that I did nothing to cause them any harm.”</p><p>Trudeau recently named a special investigator to look into allegations of Chinese interference in Canada’s last two elections. The newspaper Globe and Mail, citing unidentified intelligence officials, reported last month that China preferred to see Trudeau’s Liberals re-elected in the 2021 election and worked to defeat Conservative politicians considered unfriendly to Beijing</p><p>Opposition parties have been demanding a full public inquiry into the alleged Chinese interference.</p><p>Trudeau has said that all Canada's political leaders agree the election outcomes in 2019 and 2021 were not affected by foreign interference. But he has said that even if it didn’t change the results, any interference by a foreign actor is troubling and serious.</p><p>A panel of civil servants recently issued a report that concluded there were foreign attempts to interfere, but none affected the outcome of the election.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has corrected the lawmaker's name to Han, not Hang.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A nearly six-hour grilling of TikTok’s CEO by lawmakers brought the platform’s 150 million U.S. users no closer to an answer as to whether the app will be wiped from their devices.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers on Thursday pressed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-shou-zi-chew-testify-7927b1915db270aac67ca6f4ca31d6f3">Shou Zi Chew</a> over data security and harmful content, responding skeptically during a tense committee hearing to his assurances that the hugely popular video-sharing app prioritizes user safety and should not be banned due to its Chinese connections. </p><p>In a bipartisan effort to rein in the power of a major social media platform, Republican and Democratic lawmakers hurled questions on a host of topics, including TikTok’s content moderation practices, how the company plans to secure American data from Beijing, and its spying on journalists.</p><p>Chew spent most of the hearing attempting to push back assertions that TikTok, or its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, are tools of the Chinese government. But he failed to answer uncomfortable questions about human rights abuses committed by China against the Uyghurs, and seemed taken aback by a TikTok video displayed by one lawmaker that advocated for violence against the House committee holding the hearing.</p><p>The rare public appearance by the 40-year-old Singapore native comes at a crucial time for the company. TikTok has ballooned its American user base to 150 million in a few short years, but its increasing dominance is being threated by a potential nationwide ban in the U.S. and growing fears among officials about protecting user data from China's communist government.</p><p>There's also symbolism for lawmakers in taking on TikTok, which has been swept up in a wider geopolitical battle between Beijing and Washington over trade and technology, as well as heighted tensions due to recent balloon politics and China’s relationship with Russia. </p><p>“Mr. Chew, you are here because the American people need the truth about the threat TikTok poses to our national and personal security,” Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican, said in her opening statement. </p><div class="social-embed" id="se0:da2d2f50-c640-11ed-e565-57b8ffb4aa86"><div class="display-block"><style>@media only screen and (max-width: 415px){.htmlEmbedContent {width: 90%;margin: 0 auto;}}@media only screen and (min-width: 415px){.htmlEmbedContent {width: 70%;}}.youtube-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .youtube-container iframe { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class="youtube-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGUxzEnmRgw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div></div><p class="social-caption"> </p></div><p>Chew told the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that TikTok prioritizes the safety of its young users and denied <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew-security-risk-cc36f36801d84fc0652112fa461ef140">it's a national security risk</a>. He reiterated the company’s plan to protect U.S. user data by storing it on servers maintained and owned by the software giant Oracle.</p><p>“Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said. </p><p>Nevertheless, the company has been dogged by claims that its Chinese ownership means user data could end up in the hands of the Chinese government or that it could be used to promote narratives favorable to the country's communist leaders.</p><p>In 2019, the Guardian reported that TikTok was instructing its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square and included images unfavorable to the Chinese government. The platform says it has since changed its moderation practices.</p><div id="e7ad36d0-c640-11ed-e563-5f52d3d20197" class="related-story-embed"></div><p>Concerns about the platform increased when ByteDance admitted in December that it fired four employees who accessed data on two journalists, and people connected to them, last summer while attempting to uncover the source of a leaked report about the company. </p><p>Aware of its weakness, TikTok has been trying to distance itself from its Chinese origins, saying 60% of ByteDance is owned by global institutional investors such as Carlyle Group. </p><p>"Ownership is not at the core of addressing these concerns,” Chew said.</p><p>But for many others, it is. The Biden administration has reportedly demanded TikTok's Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company to avoid a nationwide ban. China has said <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tiktok-security-technology-social-media-2245e433b5854010ebd99b7987fc78ca">it would oppose those attempts</a>. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said at a separate committee hearing Thursday that he believes TikTok is a security threat, and “should be ended one way or another.”</p><p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said “everyone was watching” Thursday’s TikTok hearing at the White House. But she declined to comment on specific actions the administration could take to address its TikTok concerns.</p><p>In one of the most dramatic moments of the hearing, Republican Rep. Kat Cammack played a TikTok video showing a shooting gun with a caption that included the House committee, with the exact date before it was formally announced. </p><p>“You expect us to believe that you are capable of maintaining the data security, privacy and security of 150 million Americans where you can’t even protect the people in this room,” Cammack said.</p><p>TikTok said the company on Thursday removed the video and banned the account that posted it.</p><p>Concerns about what kind of content Americans encounter online, or how their data is collected by technology companies, isn't new. Congress has been wanting to curtail the amount of data tech companies collect on consumers through a national privacy law, but those efforts have failed. </p><p>At a news conference on Wednesday, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a New York Democrat and one of the few allies TikTok seemingly has on the Hill, said lawmakers concerned about protecting users shouldn’t target TikTok, but must instead focus on a national law that would protect user data across all social media platforms. Chew also noted the failure of U.S. social media companies to address the very concerns for which TikTok was being criticized. </p><p>“American social companies don’t have a good track record with data privacy and user security,” he said. "Look at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, just one example.”</p><p>Committee members also showed a host of TikTok videos that encouraged users to harm themselves and commit suicide. Many questioned why the platform’s Chinese counterpart, Douyin, does not carry the same potentially dangerous content as the American product.</p><p>Chew responded that it depends on the laws of the country where the app is operating. He said the company has about 40,000 moderators that track harmful content and an algorithm that flags material.</p><p>Wealth management firm Wedbush described the hearing as a “disaster” for TikTok that made a ban more likely if it doesn't separate from its Chinese parent. Emile El Nems, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said a ban would benefit TikTok rivals YouTube, Instagram and Snap, “likely resulting in higher revenue share of the total advertising wallet.” </p><p>To avoid a ban, TikTok has been trying to sell officials on a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-us-news-business-ap-top-news-hong-kong-4eab38c608901de16e92facc1ed5debd">$1.5 billion plan, Project Texas</a>, which routes all U.S. user data to servers owned and maintained by the software giant Oracle.</p><p>As of October, all new U.S. user data was being stored inside the country. The company started deleting all historic U.S. user data from non-Oracle servers this month, in a process expected to be completed this year, Chew said. </p><p>Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw noted that regardless of what the company does to assure lawmakers it will protect U.S. user data, the Chinese government can still have significant influence over its parent company and ask it to turn over data through its national security laws.</p><p>Congress, the White House, U.S. armed forces and more than half of U.S. states have already banned the use of the app from official devices. Similar bans have been imposed in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-privacy-cybersecurity-bytedance-china-2dce297f0aed056efe53309bbcd44a04">other countries</a> including Denmark, Canada, Great Britain and New Zealand, as well as the European Union. </p><p>A complete TikTok ban in the U.S. would risk political and popular backlash from its young user base and civil liberties groups. </p><p>David Kennedy, a former government intelligence officer who runs the cybersecurity company TrustedSec, said he agrees with restricting TikTok access on government-issued phones but that a nationwide ban might be too extreme.</p><p>“We have Tesla in China, we have Microsoft in China, we have Apple in China.

(Pavel Byrkin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>MOSCOW (AP) — It was a revealing moment during Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s tightly scripted visit to Moscow: Standing in the doorway of the Grand Kremlin Palace, he told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the two of them were “witnessing the changes that haven't been seen in more than a century, and we are pushing them together.”</p><p>“I agree,” Putin responded.</p><p>The remarks — caught on a Kremlin camera over a bodyguard’s shoulder — offered a rare glimpse into Xi’s ambitions and his relationship with Russia after more than a year of fighting in Ukraine. </p><p>While Moscow increasingly looks like a junior partner to Beijing, Xi is likely to offer a strong lifeline to Putin, his key partner in efforts to reshape the world to try to limit U.S. domination.</p><p>Xi’s unusually blunt statement capped more than 10 hours of Kremlin talks, which ended with long declarations filled with florid rhetoric about expanding the “comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation” between Russia and China, pledges to champion a multilateral approach to global affairs and criticism of Washington.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>In his concluding statement, Putin hailed the Chinese proposal for a settlement in Ukraine, which the West had all but rejected as a non-starter. The Russian leader also rolled out a slew of initiatives that cemented his country's role as a key source of energy and other raw materials for China’s giant economy. He proposed building new energy pipelines, invited the Chinese to fill the niche left after the exodus of Western businesses, and vowed to boost the export of agricultural products to China.</p><div id="afs:Card:610860613396" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9089f4d4b9c0d8bb259b706ffcf4b0f6">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Xi remained tight-lipped, avoiding any firm commitments regarding specific projects and mostly sticking to general and vague rhetoric about expanding ties.</p><p>“A lot of things that Vladimir Putin would have liked to happen did not, in fact, happen," Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history and politics at Oxford University, told The Associated Press. "There was no point at which Xi explicitly said that he accepted Russia’s position on the Ukraine war over the position of Ukraine.”</p><p>In fact, there was "a sense that China was reserving for itself the right to step away from a complete endorsement” of the Russian position, Mitter added.</p><p>Moscow and Beijing said they would increase contacts between their militaries and stage more joint sea and air patrols and drills, but there wasn't even the slightest hint from China about helping Russia with weapons, as the U.S. and other Western allies feared.</p><p>Speaking Wednesday before a Senate committee, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China so far has heeded strong U.S. warnings against providing lethal material support for Russia in Ukraine. “We have not seen them cross that — cross that line,” he said. </p><p>A top analyst at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said Beijing wants to be seen as a peacemaker and diplomatic heavyweight. </p><p>“So I think China would be very reluctant to be seen openly supporting Russia with lethal aid,” said Doug Wade, head of the DIA's China mission group. “It would undermine their whole narrative about their role in the world that they’re trying so hard to sell.”</p><p>U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby described the Putin-Xi relationship as “a marriage of convenience,” in which they pool efforts to challenge U.S. leadership, and the Russians “certainly are the junior partner.” He added at a briefing earlier this week that Putin sees Xi as “a lifeline of sorts” amid the fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>Many commentators argued that the summit marked Putin’s failure to win any specific aid from Beijing and cemented Russia’s increasingly subordinate role in the alliance with China.</p><p>“China’s domination of Russia is complete,” tweeted Sam Greene, professor in Russian politics at King’s College London. “While there were undoubtedly agreements we are not meant to know about, there is no indication here of a significant increase in military support for Russia — nor even of a willingness on Xi’s part to ramp up diplomatic support. A swing and a miss for Putin.”</p><p>After more than a year of fighting in Ukraine and bruising Western sanctions, Russia’s dependence on China has increased significantly. Facing Western restrictions on its oil, gas and other exports, Russia has shifted its energy flows to China and sharply expanded other exports, resulting in a 30% hike in bilateral trade.</p><p>Western price caps on Russia’s oil forced Moscow to offer it to China and other customers at a sharp discount, but despite those lower prices, the vast Chinese market ensured a stable flow of oil revenue to the Kremlin’s coffers.</p><p>As long as Russia can trade with China and other Asian states, it will face "no danger of running out of money or being forced to concede on the battlefield, said Chris Weafer, CEO of the consulting firm Macro-Advisory.</p><p>While profiting handsomely from Moscow’s desperate situation, Beijing would be certain to ramp up its support if it sees Russia dangerously weakened.</p><p>“The nightmare scenario for China is that collapse of Russia militarily leads to collapse of the regime and installment of some pro-Western government,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment. </p><p>Gabuev argued that Beijing would be unlikely to provide any direct military assistance to Moscow anytime soon simply because it doesn’t feel the pressing need to do so. “Russia is not doing great on the battlefield, but it’s obviously not losing it, so the need to support the Russian military efforts so far is questionable from both sides,” he said.</p><p>More than ammunition, tanks and rockets, Russia badly needs China's help in skirting Western sanctions to maintain the flow of high-tech components for its weapons industries and other economic sectors. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, predicted that China could be expected to act more resolutely to help Russia get them.</p><p>“Russia doesn’t need weapons from China,” Markov wrote on his messaging app channel. “It needs microchips and components, and they will come.”</p><p>Some observers say that while Beijing has been coy about supporting Moscow, it has vital interest in shoring up its ally to avoid being left alone in any potential confrontation with the United States. </p><p>Mikhail Korostikov, an expert on Russia-China ties, said in a commentary for the Carnegie Endowment that China has been closely watching Russia’s experience in facing massive Western sanctions. “For Beijing, a close study and partial use of instruments and decisions used by Russia is a reasonable course in a situation when China’s confrontation with the West looks inevitable,” he said.</p><p>Korostikov noted that while Moscow’s dependence on Beijing is growing, China’s room for maneuvering is also shrinking. </p><p>“There is no alternative to Russia as a partner providing resources that China will critically need in case of an escalation in its confrontation with the West,” he said. “It helps balance the situation and allows Moscow to hope that Beijing will not overuse its newly-acquired economic levers.”</p><p>___</p><p>Isachenkov has covered Russia and other former Soviet nations for The Associated Press since 1992.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Michael Weissenstein in New York, and Matthew Lee, Zeke Miller and Nomaan Merchant in Washington contributed.</p>]]></description>

The battle between the U.S. and China over TikTok comes to a head on Thursday when the social media platform’s CEO testifies before Congressional lawmakers. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)</p></figcaption></figure>      <p>The battle between the U.S. and China over TikTok came into full view on Thursday when the social media platform's CEO testified before Congressional lawmakers. </p><p>Shou Zi Chew's hearing in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce is happening at what he's called a “pivotal moment” for the hugely popular short video sharing app. TikTok is owned by parent company ByteDance, which has offices in Beijing. The platform has 150 million American users but it's been dogged by persistent claims that it threatens national security and user privacy, or could be used to promote pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-china-62ebef6be3c10e66d7f69f7f6d254700">Chew attempted to persuade lawmakers</a> not to pursue a ban on the app or force its sale to new owners. </p><p>So are the data security risks real? And should users be worried that the TikTok app will be wiped off their phones?</p><p>Here’s what to know:</p><h2>WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT TIKTOK?</h2><p>Both the FBI and officials at the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share TikTok user data — such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers — with China’s authoritarian government. </p><p>Officials fear that TikTok, which like many other social media platforms collects vast amounts of data on its users, would be forced to give it to Beijing under a 2017 law that compels companies to turn over any personal data relevant to China's national security. </p><p>Concerns around TikTok were heightened in December when ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on journalists from Buzzfeed News and The Financial Times while attempting to track down the source of a leaked report about the company. </p><div id="8830a490-c640-11ed-c86c-f9ec0747ab90" class="related-story-embed"></div><h2>HOW IS THE U.S. RESPONDING?</h2><p>In a rare, bipartisan effort to reign in the power and influence of a major social media platform, Republican and Democratic lawmakers pressed Chew during Thursday’s hearing on a host of topics, ranging from TikTok’s content moderation practices, how the company plans to secure American data from Beijing, and that it admits spying on journalists.</p><p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. — known as CFIUS and part of the Treasury Department — is also carrying out a review, and has reportedly threatened a U.S. ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stake. China’s Foreign Ministry in turn accused the United States itself of spreading disinformation about TikTok’s potential security risks. </p><p>White House officials have said there are “legitimate national security concerns with respect to data integrity." </p><p>Some U.S. senators urged CFIUS last year to quickly wrap up its investigation and "impose strict structural restrictions” between TikTok's American operations and ByteDance, including potentially separating the companies. </p><p>At the same time, lawmakers have introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration's authority to enact a national ban on TikTok. The White House has already backed a Senate proposal that has bipartisan support. </p><h2>HOW HAS TIKTOK ALREADY BEEN RESTRICTED?</h2><p>Authorities in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-privacy-cybersecurity-bytedance-china-2dce297f0aed056efe53309bbcd44a04">have banned the TikTok app</a>, mostly on government-issued phones or devices used for official business, citing cybersecurity concerns. Last week <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-tiktok-government-ban-470538b4030cf6213dc655da45188023">Britain imposed a government phone ban</a> while <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-zealand-tiktok-ban-lawmakers-parliament-workers-36c42f94d236d5d714d4fb0dd8ac2f45">New Zealand restricted lawmakers</a> and other workers in its Parliament from having it on their phones. </p><p>The European Union’s three main institutions, the executive Commission, Parliament and Council, have ordered staffers to remove it from their work phones. So has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/denmark-tiktok-ban-defense-ministry-c3f434fa46401ea93329e1f5cb132432">Denmark's defense ministry</a>. The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mobile-apps-canada-government-united-states-justin-trudeau-43b27a80a1c2bf3b55e5ccf2ce573684">Canadian government said its ban</a> includes blocking civil servants from downloading the app in the future. Norway and Netherlands warned this week against installing TikTok on government devices.</p><p>The White House ordered U.S. federal agencies to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the U.S. armed forces and more than half of U.S. states had already banned the app.</p><div class="social-embed" id="se0:a17d6370-c640-11ed-fb42-9dc9734e4c37"><div style="position:relative; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/pjR2WJLd-c7p1GuNr.html" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto" title="Why the U.S. is cracking down on TikTok" style="position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div><p class="social-caption"> </p></div><h2>WHAT DOES TIKTOK SAY?</h2><p>Chew, a 40-year-old Singapore native, told the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that TikTok prioritizes the safety of its young users and denied allegations that the app is a national security risk. He reiterated the company’s plan to protect U.S. user data by storing all such information on servers maintained and owned by the software giant Oracle.</p><p>Under <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-us-news-business-ap-top-news-hong-kong-4eab38c608901de16e92facc1ed5debd">a $1.5 billion project dubbed Project Texas</a> that's underway, data from U.S. users is being routed through servers controlled by Oracle, the Silicon Valley company it partnered with in an effort to avoid a nationwide ban. </p><p>Older U.S. user data stored on non-Oracle servers will be deleted this year. Under this arrangement, there's no way for Beijing to access the data, Chew said in prepared remarks released ahead of the hearing. </p><p>TikTok has also sought to portray ByteDance as a global company, not a Chinese one. Executives have been pointing out that ByteDance's ownership consists of 60% big global investors, 20% employees and 20% Chinese entrepreneurs who founded the company. TikTok itself is headquartered in Singapore.</p><h2>ARE THE SECURITY RISKS LEGITIMATE?</h2><p>It depends on who you ask. </p><p>Some tech privacy advocates say while the potential abuse of privacy by the Chinese government is concerning, other tech companies have data-harvesting business practices that also exploit user information. </p><p>“If policy makers want to protect Americans from surveillance, they should advocate for a basic privacy law that bans all companies from collecting so much sensitive data about us in the first place, rather than engaging in what amounts to xenophobic showboating that does exactly nothing to protect anyone,” said Evan Greer, director of the nonprofit advocacy group Fight for the Future.</p><p>Karim Farhat, a researcher with the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Tech, said a TikTok sale would be “completely irrelevant to any of the alleged ‘national security’ threats” and go against “every free market principle and norm” of the state department’s internet freedom principles. </p><p>Others say there is legitimate reason for concern.</p><p>People who use TikTok might think they’re not doing anything that would be of interest to a foreign government, but that’s not always the case, said Anton Dahbura, executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. Important information about the United States is not strictly limited to nuclear power plants or military facilities; it extends to other sectors, such as food processing, the finance industry and universities, Dahbura said.</p><h2>IS THERE PRECEDENCE FOR BANNING TECH COMPANIES?</h2><p>The U.S. has banned the communications equipment sold by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, citing national security risks. But banning the sale of items is easier than banning a free app.</p><p>Such a move might also wind up in courts on grounds that it could violate the First Amendment, as some civil liberties groups have argued. </p><p>Another possibility, albeit remote, is forcing a sale. That's what happened in 2020 when Beijing Kunlun, a Chinese mobile video game company, agreed to sell gay dating app Grindr after an order from CFIUS. </p><p>Beijing Kunlun said it signed a "national security agreement” with CFIUS to sell Grindr to San Vicente Acquisition for $608.5 million, promising not to send sensitive user data to China, cease its operations there and maintain its headquarters in the U.S. </p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Jess Rapfogel)</p></figcaption></figure>        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — TikTok is ramping up a public relations campaign to fend off the possibility of a nationwide ban by the Biden administration, and it’s bringing some unconventional advocates to help: online influencers. </p><p>Dozens of TikTok creators — some with millions of followers on the video-sharing app — came to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to lobby in favor of the platform, one day before lawmakers are slated to grill the company’s chief executive about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-bytedance-china-biden-administration-14ef5f93dc2114e4ade110b2e85433fd">concerns over user data falling into the hands of the Chinese government</a>. </p><p>Shou Zi Chew plans to tell Congress on Thursday that TikTok, which was founded by Chinese entrepreneurs, is committed to user safety, data protection and security, and keeping the platform free from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-tiktok-facebook-influencers-propaganda-81388bca676c560e02a1b493ea9d6760">Chinese government influence</a>. He will also answer questions from U.S. lawmakers worried about the social media platform's effects on its young user base. </p><p>At the heart of TikTok’s trouble is a Chinese national intelligence law that would compel Chinese companies to fork over data to the government for whatever purposes it deems to involve national security. There's also concern Beijing might try to push pro-China narratives or misinformation through the platform.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>At a media event coordinated by TikTok on Wednesday, some content creators acknowledged that concerns about data security are legitimate, but pointed to precautions the company is taking, such as a $1.5 billion plan — dubbed Project Texas — to route all U.S. data to domestic servers owned and maintained by the software giant Oracle. </p><div id="afs:Card:530404428163" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="62ebef6be3c10e66d7f69f7f6d254700">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>TikTok has been attempting to sell that proposal to the Biden administration, but skeptics have argued it doesn't go far enough. The administration is reportedly demanding the company's Chinese owners sell their stakes or face a nationwide ban. </p><p>Janette Ok, a fashion and beauty influencer on TikTok, said in an interview Wednesday that TikTok invited her to the lobbying event a few weeks ago and paid for her trip to Washington. She’s been able to make a full-time career from her videos, earning income from partnerships with brands looking to capture the eyes of her 1.7 million followers. She said her popularity on TikTok has also allowed her to have other opportunities, like TV and commercial acting roles. </p><p>“I don’t know much about politics, but I know a lot about fashion, and I know a lot about people,” Ok said. “And just to be here and share my story is what TikTok has invited me to do.” </p><p>Tensions around TikTok have been building on Capitol Hill, reaching a boiling point late last year when a proposal to ban the app off of government phones passed with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Joe Biden. House Republicans are pushing a bill that would give Biden the power to ban the app. </p><p>Other bills have also been introduced — some bipartisan — including a measure that would circumvent the challenges the administration would face in court if it moved forward with sanctions against the social media company.</p><p>The effort to target TikTok is part of a larger, tougher approach that Congress has taken in the past several months as China’s relationship with two U.S. adversaries — Russia and Iran — has come into focus. A recent incident with a spy balloon forced even some wary congressional Democrats to join Republicans in opposition, and there is now a strong bipartisan concern in Washington that Beijing would use legal and regulatory power to seize American user data or use the platform to push favorable narratives or misinformation.</p><p>But the company has also gotten support from at least three progressive lawmakers who say they oppose a ban on the platform. At a news conference Wednesday with the influencers, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., characterized the national security concerns that have been raised as xenophobic hysteria due to TikTok's Chinese origins. He said if Congress wants to have an “honest” conversation about data collection, it should focus on a national privacy law that targets all social media companies - not just TikTok. </p><p>“Usually when there's an issue of national security concern, they hold a bipartisan Congressional briefing on that particular issue,” Bowman said. “We have not received a bipartisan Congressional briefing on the national security risk of TikTok.”</p><p>TikTok’s response to the political pressure can be seen all around the nation’s Capitol, with the company putting up ads in area airports and metro stations that include promises of securing users data and privacy and creating a safe platform for its young users. Last year, the company spent more than $5.3 million on dispatching lobbyists to the Hill to make its case, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit that tracks lobbying spending.</p><p>On Thursday, Chew will be sticking to a familiar script as he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-china-cybersecurity-data-privacy-595f9ae7c0a1fc22f0b285cede6bd67c">urges officials against pursuing an all-out ban</a> on TikTok or for the company to be sold off to new owners. TikTok's efforts to ensure the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-social-media-mobile-apps-europe-business-f7ab42849333c88d337e763f6177f889">security of its users' data</a> go “above and beyond” what any of its rivals are doing, according to Chew's prepared remarks released ahead of his appearance before the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce. </p><p>Chew pushed back against fears that TikTok could become a tool of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-tiktok-new-zealand-britain-us-f8ead4d3b05c2f5df5ec4a435961d7f7#">China's ruling Communist Party</a> because its parent company, ByteDance, was founded in Beijing and also operates from there.</p><p>“Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said. </p><p>He distanced TikTok from its Chinese roots and denied the “inaccurate” belief that TikTok's corporate structure makes it “beholden to the Chinese government." ByteDance has evolved into a privately held “global enterprise,” Chew said, with 60% owned by big institutional investors, 20% owned by the Chinese entrepreneurs who founded it and the rest by employees. </p><p>It's “emphatically untrue” that TikTok sends data on its American users to Beijing, he said. </p><p>"TikTok has never shared, or received a request to share, U.S. user data with the Chinese government," Chew said. “Nor would TikTok honor such a request if one were ever made.”</p><p>Whether those promises will alleviate concern is another matter. TikTok has come under fire in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific, where a growing number of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/why-is-tiktok-being-banned-7d2de01d3ac5ab2b8ec2239dc7f2b20d">governments have banned the app from devices</a> used for official business. India, Afghanistan and Indonesia have banned it nationwide.</p><p>Chew, a 40-year-old Singaporean who was appointed CEO in 2021, said in a TikTok video this week that the congressional hearing comes at a “pivotal moment” for the company, which now has 150 million American users. </p><p>Chew said TikTok’s data security project is the right answer, not a ban or a sale of the company.</p><p>“No other social media company, or entertainment platform like TikTok, provides this level of access and transparency,” he said.</p><p>The company started deleting the historical protected data of U.S. users from non-Oracle servers this month, Chew said. When that process is completed later this year, all U.S. data will be protected by American law and controlled by a U.S.-led security team. </p><p>“Under this structure, there is no way for the Chinese government to access it or compel access to it,” he said. </p><p>He said a TikTok ban would hurt the U.S. economy and small American businesses that use the app to sell their products, while reducing competition in an “increasingly concentrated market.” He added that a sale “would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access.”</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BEIJING (AP) — When China suddenly scrapped onerous zero-COVID measures in December, the country wasn’t ready for a massive onslaught of cases, with hospitals turning away ambulances and crematoriums burning bodies around the clock.</p><p>Chinese state media claimed the decision to open up was based on “scientific analysis and shrewd calculation,” and “by no means impulsive." But in reality, China’s ruling Communist Party held off on repeated efforts by top medical experts to kickstart exit plans until it was too late, The Associated Press found.</p><p>Instead, the reopening came suddenly at the onset of winter, when the virus spreads most easily. Many older people weren’t vaccinated, pharmacies lacked antivirals, and hospitals didn’t have adequate supplies or staff — leading to as many as hundreds of thousands of deaths that may have been avoided, according to academic modeling, more than 20 interviews with current and former China Center for Disease Control and Prevention employees, experts and government advisers, and internal reports and directives obtained by the AP.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“If they had a real plan to exit earlier, so many things could have been avoided,” said Zhang Zuo-Feng, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Many deaths could have been prevented.”</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="d7e7cf42b8f4b97e2744b640f431a7df">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Experts estimate that many hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps more, may have died in China’s wave of COVID-19 — far higher than the official toll of under 90,000, but still a significantly lower death rate than in the United States and Europe. However, 200,000 to 300,000 deaths could have been prevented if the country was better vaccinated and stocked with antivirals, according to <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.14.22283460v1.full.pdf">modeling by the University of Hong Kong</a>. Some scientists estimate even more lives could have been saved.</p><p>“It wasn’t a sound public health decision at all,” said a China CDC official, declining to be named to speak candidly on a sensitive matter. “It’s absolutely bad timing … this was not a prepared opening.”</p><p>For two years, China stood out for its tough but successful controls against the virus, credited with saving millions of lives as other countries struggled with stop-and-start lockdowns. But with the emergence of the highly infectious omicron variant in late 2021, many of China’s top medical experts and officials worried zero-COVID was unsustainable.</p><p>In late 2021, China’s leaders began discussing how to lift restrictions. As early as March 2022, top medical experts submitted a detailed reopening strategy to the State Council, China’s cabinet. The existence of the document is being reported for the first time by the AP.</p><p>But discussions were silenced after an outbreak the same month in Shanghai, which prompted Chinese leader Xi Jinping to lock the city down. Chinese public health experts stopped speaking publicly about preparing for an exit, as they were wary of openly challenging a policy supported by Xi.</p><p>By the time the Shanghai outbreak was under control, China was months away from the 20th Party Congress, the country’s most important political meeting in a decade, making reopening politically difficult. So the country stuck to mass testing and quarantining millions of people.</p><p>“Everybody waits for the party congress,” said one medical expert, declining to be named to comment on a sensitive topic. “There’s inevitably a degree of everyone being very cautious.”</p><p>At the Congress in mid-October, top officials differing with Xi were sidelined. Instead, six loyalists followed Xi onstage in a new leadership lineup, signaling his total domination of the party.</p><p>With the congress over, some voices in the public health sector finally piped up. In an internal document published Oct. 28, obtained by The Associated Press and reported here for the first time, Wu Zunyou, China’s CDC chief epidemiologist, criticized the Beijing city government for excessive COVID-19 controls, saying it had “no scientific basis." He called it a “distortion” of the central government’s zero-COVID policy, which risked “intensifying public sentiment and causing social dissatisfaction.”</p><p>At the same time, he called the virus policies of the central government “absolutely correct.” One former CDC official said Wu felt helpless because he was ordered to advocate for zero-COVID in public, even as he disagreed at times with its excesses in private.</p><p>Wu did not respond to an email requesting comment. A person acquainted with Wu confirmed he wrote the internal report.</p><p>Another who spoke up was Zhong Nanshan, a doctor renowned for raising the alarm about the original COVID outbreak Wuhan. He wrote to Xi personally, telling him that zero-COVID was not sustainable and urging a gradual reopening, said a person acquainted with Zhong. </p><p>In early November, then-Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, China’s top “COVID czar,” summoned experts from sectors including health, travel and the economy to discuss adjusting Beijing’s virus policies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings. On Nov. 10, Xi ordered adjustments.</p><p>The next day, Beijing announced 20 new measures tweaking restrictions, such as reclassifying risk zones and reducing quarantine times. But at the same time, Xi made clear, China was sticking to zero-COVID.</p><p>The government wanted order. Instead, the measures caused chaos.</p><p>With conflicting signals from the top, local governments weren’t sure whether to lock down or open up. Policies changed by the day.</p><p>In late November, public frustration boiled over. A deadly apartment fire in China’s far west Xinjiang region sparked nationwide protests over locked doors and other virus control measures. Some called on Xi to resign, the most direct challenge to the Communist Party’s power since pro-democracy protests in 1989.</p><p>Riot police moved in and the protests were swiftly quelled. But behind the scenes, the mood was shifting.</p><p>References to zero-COVID vanished from government statements. State newswire Xinhua said the pandemic was causing “fatigue, anxiety and tension,” and that the cost of controlling it was increasing day by day.</p><p>Days after the protests, Sun held meetings where she told medical experts the state planned to “walk briskly” out of zero-COVID. The final decision was made suddenly, and with little direct input from public health experts, several told the AP.</p><p>“None of us expected the 180-degree turn,” a government adviser said.</p><p>Many in the Chinese government believe the protests accelerated Xi’s decision to scrap virus controls entirely, according to three current and former state employees.</p><p>“It was the trigger,” said one, not identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.</p><p>On Dec. 6, Xi instructed officials to change COVID-19 controls, Xinhua reported.</p><p>The next day, Chinese health authorities announced 10 sweeping measures that effectively scrapped controls, canceling virus test requirements, mandatory centralized quarantine and location-tracking health QR codes. The decision to reopen so suddenly caught the country by surprise.</p><p>“Even three days’ notice would have been good,” said a former China CDC official. “The way this happened was just unbelievable.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP reporter Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

So the country stuck to mass testing and quarantining millions of people, even as omicron evaded increasingly harsh controls.</p><p>Unrest began to simmer, with demonstrations, factory riots, and shuttered businesses. The pressure mounted until the authorities suddenly yielded, allowing the virus to sweep the country with no warning — and with deadly consequence.</p><p>Experts estimate that many hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps more, may have died in China’s wave of COVID — far higher than the official toll of under 90,000, but still a significantly lower death rate than in the United States and Europe.

The less lethal but far more infectious omicron made curbing COVID-19 harder and the risks of its spread lower, and nearby Korea, Japan and Singapore were all loosening controls.</p><p>That winter, the State Council appointed public health experts to a new committee tasked with reviewing COVID-19 controls, which submitted a report in March 2022, four people with knowledge of it said. The existence of the document is being reported for the first time by the AP.</p><p>It concluded it was time for China to begin preparations for a possible reopening. It ran over 100 pages long and included detailed proposals to boost China’s stalling vaccination campaign, increase ICU bed capacity, stock up on antivirals, and order patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms to stay at home, one of the people said. It also included a proposal to designate Hainan, a tropical island in the country’s south, as a pilot zone to experiment with relaxing controls.</p><p>But then things began going awry.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-business-health-pandemics-hong-kong-61c2a448663e0288508cb46d8a553b24?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP">A chaotic, deadly outbreak in Hong Kong</a> alarmed Beijing. Then in March, the virus began spreading in Shanghai, China’s cosmopolitan finance hub.</p><p>Initially, Shanghai took a light approach with targeted lockdowns sealing individual buildings — a pioneering strategy led by doctor Zhang Wenhong, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-business-infectious-diseases-public-health-732de4c302e379ac33c92d20c425ae2e">who had been openly calling on the government to prepare to reopen</a>. But soon, officials in neighboring provinces complained they were seeing cases from Shanghai and asked the central leadership to lock the city down, according to three people familiar with the matter. </p><p>China CDC contact tracing reports obtained by the AP show that a nearby province was detecting dozens of COVID-19 cases by early March, all from Shanghai. Provincial officials argued that they lacked Shanghai’s medical resources and capacity to trace the virus, risking its spread to the entire country before China was ready.</p><p>At the same time, China’s flagging vaccination rate for older residents and the deaths in Hong Kong spooked authorities, as did reports of long COVID-19 abroad. When Shanghai failed to get control of the virus, the top leadership stepped in. Partial lockdowns in Shanghai were announced in late March. On April 2, then-Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, a top official known widely as the “COVID czar," <a href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqfkdt/202204/2361ebedb61f4113a8a3649bd85bc871.shtml">traveled there to oversee a total lockdown</a>.</p><p>“They lost their nerve,” said an expert in regular contact with Chinese health officials.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-china-shanghai-wuhan-ab6e4fd3cfd587a76e32f29b6800378c">Shanghai was ill-prepared.</a> Residents exploded in anger online, complaining of hunger and spotty supplies. But Beijing made it clear that the lockdown would continue.</p><p>“Resolutely uphold zero-COVID," an editorial in the state-run People’s Daily said. <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/2022-03/24/c_1128498251.htm">“Persistence is victory,”</a> said Xi. </p><p>___</p><h2>KEEPING SILENCE</h2><p>After Shanghai locked down, Chinese public health experts stopped speaking publicly about preparing for an exit. None were willing to openly challenge a policy supported by Xi. Some experts were blacklisted from Chinese media, one told the AP.</p><p>“Anybody who wanted to say something that is different from the official narrative was basically just silenced,” the blacklisted expert said.</p><p>In early April, China’s State Council <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3173879/chinas-foreign-firms-desperate-shift-away-old-toolbox-mass">leaked a letter from the European Chamber of Commerce</a> urging relaxation of zero-COVID controls. Council officials wanted to spark debate but didn’t feel empowered to raise the issue themselves, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.</p><p>The State Council’s information office did not respond to a fax requesting comment.</p><p>Gao Fu, then head of the China CDC, also hinted at the need to prepare for an exit. At a mid-April internal panel discussion recently made public by the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization think tank, <a href="https://ccgupdate.substack.com/p/ccg-in-april-recommended-chinese">Gao was quoted as saying</a> “omicron is not that dangerous," that there were public discussions on whether zero-COVID needed to be adjusted, and that they “hope to reach a consensus as soon as possible.”</p><p>Weeks later, Gao appeared at a private event on COVID exit strategies around the world at the German Embassy in Beijing and urged more vaccinations in China, according to three attendees who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Gao did not respond to an email requesting comment.</p><p>There were also hints that opinions differed high in the party.</p><p>In private meetings with Western business chambers in May, then-Premier Li Keqiang, who was head of the State Council and the party’s No. 2 official at the time, appeared sympathetic to complaints about how zero-COVID was crushing the economy, according to a participant and another briefed on the meetings. It was a stark contrast with <a href="http://nl.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/zgyw/202205/t20220518_10688542.htm">pre-recorded remarks from Xi</a> that listed defeating COVID as the top priority. But under Xi, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-premier-li-keqiang-congress-economy-a34da9c38039be728a3bdfc9a0574eb0">Li was powerless,</a> analysts say.</p><p>Public health experts split into camps. Those who thought zero-COVID unsustainable — like Gao and Zhang, the Shanghai doctor — fell silent. But Liang Wannian, then head of the central government’s expert working group on COVID-19, kept vocally advocating for zero-COVID as a way to defeat the virus. Though Liang has a doctorate in epidemiology, he is sometimes accused of pushing the party line rather than science-driven policies.</p><p>“He knows what Xi wants to hear,” said Ray Yip, the founding head of the United States CDC office in China.</p><p>Liang shot down suggestions for reopening in internal meetings in January and May of 2022, Yip said, making it difficult for others to suggest preparations for an exit. Liang did not respond to an email requesting comment.</p><p>Health authorities also knew that once China reopened, there would be no going back. Some were spooked by unclear data, long COVID and the chance of deadlier strains, leaving them wracked with uncertainty.</p><p>“Every day, we were flooded with oceans of unverified data,” said a China CDC official. “Every week we heard about new variants. … Yes, we should find a way out of zero-COVID, but when and how?”</p><p>Authorities may also have been waiting for the virus to weaken further or for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-science-technology-health-00e7e5ebf9460bad115b491009b58bef">new, more effective, Chinese-developed mRNA vaccines.</a></p><p>“They didn’t have a sense of urgency,” said Zhu Hongshen, a postdoctoral fellow studying China’s zero-COVID policy at the University of Pennsylvania. “They thought they could optimize the whole process, they thought they had time.”</p><p>The Shanghai lockdown stretched from an expected eight days to two months. By the time Shanghai opened back up, it was just months away from China’s pivotal 20th Party Congress, where Xi was expected to be confirmed for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/xi-jinping-china-president-vote-5e6230d8c881dc17b11a781e832accd1">a controversial and precedent-breaking third term.</a></p><p>Risking an outbreak was off the table. Though scientists from Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan wrote internal petitions urging the government to start preparations, they were told to stay quiet until the congress was over.</p><p>“Everybody waits for the party congress,” said one medical expert, declining to be named to comment on a sensitive topic. “There’s inevitably a degree of everyone being very cautious.”</p><p>___</p><h2>INCREASING PRESSURE</h2><p>Officials across China took extraordinary measures to stop omicron from spreading.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-travel-99d16a6da3f4dda26f370be6786041e9">Tourists were locked into hotels</a>, traders were huddled into indefinite quarantine and many stopped traveling for fear of being stranded far from home. In Inner Mongolia, a state-run ammunition factory forced workers to live in its compound 24 hours a day for weeks on end away from their families, according to Moses Xu, a retired worker.</p><p>In brutal lockdowns for over three months in China’s far west, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-shanghai-government-and-politics-e40fb7fdd74f395571b7604fa6ee5d3e">residents in Xinjiang starved</a>, while <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-beijing-xi-jinping-shanghai-631ee1b6a906bfc9ef7475ed6ed64406">thousands in Tibet marched on the streets</a>, defying orders in a rare protest. Still, officials stuck to their guns, as the government fired those who didn’t keep COVID under control. </p><p>Yet omicron kept spreading. As the congress approached, authorities began hiding cases and resorting to secret lockdowns and quarantines.</p><p>Authorities locked down Zhengzhou, a provincial capital home to over 10 million people, with no public announcement, even though they were reporting only a handful of cases. They bused some Beijing residents to distant quarantine centers and asked them not to post online about it, one told the AP. Some village officials deliberately underreported the number of COVID-19 cases to give the sense that the virus was under control.</p><p>Local governments poured tens of billions of dollars into mass testing and quarantine facilities. From Wuhan to villages in industrial Hebei province, civil servants were pressed into testing or quarantine duty because local governments ran out of money to hire workers.</p><p>At the Congress in mid-October, top officials differing with Xi were sidelined. Instead, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/xi-jinping-li-keqiang-china-beijing-government-and-politics-4a0e0d4d9b60be451b8ea2c6608062a5">six loyalists followed Xi onstage</a> in a new leadership lineup, signaling his total domination of the party.</p><p>___</p><h2>PUSHING FOR CHANGE</h2><p>With the congress over, some voices in the public health sector finally piped up.</p><p>In an internal document published Oct. 28, obtained by The Associated Press and reported here for the first time, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at China’s CDC, criticized the Beijing city government for excessive COVID controls, saying it had “no scientific basis." He called it a “distortion” of the central government’s zero-COVID policy, which risked “intensifying public sentiment and causing social dissatisfaction.”</p><p>At the same time, he called the virus policies of the central government “absolutely correct.” One former CDC official said Wu felt helpless because he was ordered to advocate for zero-COVID in public, even as he disagreed at times with its excesses in private.</p><p>Wu did not respond to an email requesting comment. A person acquainted with Wu confirmed he wrote the internal report.</p><p>Another who spoke up was Zhong Nanshan, a doctor renowned for raising the alarm about the original COVID-19 outbreak Wuhan. He wrote twice to Xi personally, telling him that zero-COVID was not sustainable and urging a gradual reopening, said a person acquainted with Zhong. Business people in finance, trade, and manufacturing concerned about the tanking economy were also lobbying authorities behind the scenes, a government adviser told the AP.</p><p>Along with the lobbying, pressure to reopen came from outbreaks flaring up across the country. A Nov. 5 internal notice issued by Beijing health authorities and obtained by the AP called the virus situation “severe.”</p><p>In early November, Sun, China’s top “COVID czar,” summoned experts from sectors including health, travel and the economy to discuss adjusting Beijing’s virus policies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings. Zhong, the prominent doctor, presented data from Hong Kong showing omicron’s low fatality rate after the city’s last outbreak, two said.</p><p>On Nov. 10, Xi ordered adjustments.</p><p>“Adhere to scientific and precise prevention and control,” Xi said, <a href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/wjw/mtbd/202301/53e4bdbadd0f4a3384c0af7e38f16427.shtml">according to a state media account</a>, signaling he wanted officials to cut back on extreme measures.</p><p>The next day, Beijing announced 20 new measures tweaking restrictions, such as reclassifying risk zones and reducing quarantine times. But at the same time, Xi made clear, China was sticking to zero-COVID.</p><p>“Necessary epidemic prevention measures cannot be relaxed,” Xi said.</p><p>___</p><h2>THE EXIT</h2><p>The government wanted order. Instead, the measures caused chaos.</p><p>With conflicting signals from the top, local governments weren’t sure whether to lock down or open up. Policies changed by the day.</p><p>In Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, officials canceled mass testing and opened the city, only to reinstate harsh measures days later. Xi called city officials, instructing them to have measures that were neither too strict nor too soft, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Individual apartments were put under sudden lockdowns that lasted hours or days. The sheer number of tests and cases overwhelmed medical workers. Travel, shopping, and dining ground to a halt, streets emptied, and the wealthy bought one-way plane tickets out of China.</p><p>In late November, public frustration boiled over. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-fires-6a1b6902e6ccf87e064f1232045a2848">A deadly apartment fire in China’s far west Xinjiang region</a> sparked nationwide protests over locked doors and other virus control measures. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-xi-jinping-shanghai-covid-b85c65c576b9326c012a19422ae2dc82">Some called on Xi to resign</a>, the most direct challenge to the Communist Party’s power since pro-democracy protests in 1989.</p><p>Riot police moved in and the protests were swiftly quelled. But behind the scenes, the mood was shifting.</p><p>References to “zero-COVID” vanished from government statements. State newswire Xinhua said <a href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/wjw/mtbd/202301/53e4bdbadd0f4a3384c0af7e38f16427.shtml">the pandemic was causing “fatigue, anxiety and tension,”</a> and that the cost of controlling it was increasing day by day.</p><p>Days after the protests, Sun, the COVID czar, held meetings where she told medical experts the state planned to “walk briskly” out of zero-COVID. Some were struck by how quickly the tone had shifted, with one saying the leadership had become “even more radical” than the experts, according to a retired official.</p><p>On Dec. 1, Xi told visiting European Council President Charles Michel that the protests were driven by youth frustrated with the lockdowns, according to a person briefed on Xi’s remarks.</p><p>“We listen to our people,” the person recounted Xi telling Michel.</p><p>The final decision was made suddenly, and with little direct input from public health experts, several told the AP.</p><p>“None of us expected the 180-degree turn,” a government adviser said.</p><p>Many in the Chinese government believe the protests accelerated Xi’s decision to scrap virus controls entirely, according to three current and former state employees.</p><p>“It was the trigger,” said one, not identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.</p><p>On Dec. 6, Xi instructed officials to change COVID-19 controls, <a href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/wjw/mtbd/202301/53e4bdbadd0f4a3384c0af7e38f16427.shtml">Xinhua reported</a>.</p><p>The next day, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-business-china-covid-economy-e5559f6062cf052a71ad6ba1ceece693">Chinese health authorities announced 10 sweeping measures</a> that effectively scrapped controls, canceling virus test requirements, mandatory centralized quarantine and location-tracking health QR codes. The decision to reopen so suddenly caught the country by surprise.</p><p>“Even three days’ notice would have been good,” said a former China CDC official. “The way this happened was just unbelievable.”</p><p>Soon, the sick overran emergency wards and patients sprawled on floors. COVID-19 antivirals sold for thousands of dollars a box on the black market.</p><p>In just six weeks, about 80% of the country was infected — more than a billion people, the China CDC later estimated. But even as deaths mounted, authorities ordered state media to deflect criticism over China’s sudden reopening, according to a leaked directive <a href="https://twitter.com/wangzhian8848/status/1606634446345883648?s=20">obtained by a former state media journalist</a> and <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/691232.html">posted online.</a></p><p>“Make a big propaganda push,” it ordered. “Counter the false claims leveled by the United States and the West that we were 'forced to open' and ‘hadn’t prepared.'” </p><p>___</p><p>AP reporter Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>This story was first published on March 22, 2023. It was updated on March 24, 2023, to correct that China CDC director Gao Fu, at a private event at the German Embassy in Beijing, didn’t say he agreed with the foreign experts about China reopening, but rather urged more vaccinations in China.</p>]]></description>

It says a project to store American user data in the U.S. will put it out of China's reach and it disputes accusations that it collects any more user data than U.S. social media companies do. </p><p>The arguments fell flat with U.S. lawmakers who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-ceo-congressional-hearing-bytedance-china-44d948c5b0ba18e2a714e0fa62d52779">grilled the company’s CEO</a> last month, with some pushing for a total ban for American users amid reports that Washington wants to force ByteDance to sell off TikTok.</p><p>Many governments remain cautious about the platform and its ties to China. Here are the places that have implemented partial or total bans on TikTok:</p><h2>AFGHANISTAN</h2><p>Afghanistan’s Taliban leadership banned TikTok and the game PUBG in 2022 on the grounds of protecting young people from “being misled.”</p><h2>AUSTRALIA</h2><p>TikTok was banned from devices issued by the Australian federal government. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-australia-ban-government-devices-ce06a8d4215bbf8b85b692d91f96cf32">made the decision after getting advice</a> from the country's intelligence and security agencies. </p><p>BELGIUM</p><p>Belgium <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-belgium-china-cybersecurity-b976fe2a56c58996e84c1040ddd7f1ad">temporarily banned TikTok</a> from devices owned or paid for by the federal government, citing worries about cybersecurity, privacy and misinformation. Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said the six-month ban was based on warnings from the country's state security service and cybersecurity center. </p><h2>CANADA</h2><p>Canada announced government-issued devices must not use TikTok, saying that it presents an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mobile-apps-canada-government-united-states-justin-trudeau-43b27a80a1c2bf3b55e5ccf2ce573684">“unacceptable” risk to privacy and security</a>. Employees will also be blocked from downloading the app in the future. </p><h2>DENMARK</h2><p>Denmark’s Defense Ministry banned its employees from having TikTok on their work phones, ordering staffers who have installed it to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/denmark-tiktok-ban-defense-ministry-c3f434fa46401ea93329e1f5cb132432">remove the app from devices</a> as soon as possible. The ministry said the reasons for the ban included both “weighty security considerations” as well as “very limited work-related need to use the app.” </p><h2>EUROPEAN UNION</h2><p>The European Parliament, European Commission and the EU Council, the 27-member bloc’s three main institutions, have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-united-states-government-privacy-business-29a52f0eee4177f6c2a596d12459feec">imposed bans on TikTok</a> on staff devices. Under the European Parliament’s ban, lawmakers and staff were also advised to remove the TikTok app from their personal devices.</p><h2>FRANCE</h2><p>“Recreational” use of TikTok and other social media apps like Twitter and Instagram on government employees’ phones has been banned <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-france-ban-cybersecurity-china-4c48564fbfe7b86bf44c30969902c293">because of worries about insufficient data security</a> measures. The French government's statement didn't name specific apps but noted the decision came after other governments took measures targeting TikTok. </p><h2>INDIA</h2><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/asia-pacific-virus-outbreak-india-new-delhi-international-news-bd02ecd62ff9da6b1301868f0308e297">India imposed a nationwide ban</a> on TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps like messaging app WeChat in 2020 over privacy and security concerns. The ban came shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border killed 20 Indian soldiers and injured dozens. The companies were given a chance to respond to questions on privacy and security requirements but the ban was made permanent in January 2021.</p><h2>LATVIA</h2><p>Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics <a href="https://twitter.com/edgarsrinkevics/status/1630843966378704896?s=20">tweeted that he deleted</a> his TikTok account and that the app is also prohibited from official foreign ministry smartphones. </p><h2>NETHERLANDS</h2><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-netherlands-ban-cybersecurity-df5b67d59875a3b4f48c494ab26fe682">Dutch central government banned apps</a> including TikTok from employee work phones citing data security concerns. A government statement did not name TikTok specifically but said civil servants are discouraged from having apps "from countries with an offensive cyber program against the Netherlands and/or Dutch interests installed and used on their mobile work devices.” </p><h2>NEW ZEALAND</h2><p>Lawmakers in New Zealand and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-zealand-tiktok-ban-lawmakers-parliament-workers-36c42f94d236d5d714d4fb0dd8ac2f45">staff at the nation’s Parliament</a> will be prohibited from having the TikTok app on their work phones, following advice from government cybersecurity experts. The app will be removed from all devices with access to the parliamentary network, although officials can make special arrangements for anybody who needs TikTok to perform their democratic duties.</p><h2>NORWAY</h2><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tiktok-security-technology-social-media-2245e433b5854010ebd99b7987fc78ca">Norwegian parliament banned Tiktok</a> on work devices, after the country's Justice Ministry warned the app shouldn't be installed on phones issued to government employees. The Parliament's speaker said TikTok shouldn't be on devices that have access to the assembly’s systems and should be removed as quickly as possible. The country's capital Oslo and second largest city Bergen also urged municipal employees to remove TikTok from their work phones.</p><h2>PAKISTAN</h2><p>Pakistani authorities have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-peshawar-china-pakistan-6a50ac59d02a9a0f7450777ed47d64fd">temporarily banned TikTok</a> at least four times since October 2020, citing concerns that app promotes immoral content.</p><h2>TAIWAN</h2><p>In December 2022, Taiwan imposed a public sector ban on TikTok after the FBI warned that TikTok posed a national security risk. Government devices, including mobile phones, tablets and desktop computers, are not allowed to use Chinese-made software, which include apps like TikTok, its Chinese equivalent Douyin, or Xiaohongshu, a Chinese lifestyle content app.</p><div id="afs:Card:701802223116" content-id="2dce297f0aed056efe53309bbcd44a04" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><h2>UNITED KINGDOM</h2><p>British authorities in mid-March <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-tiktok-government-ban-470538b4030cf6213dc655da45188023">banned TikTok from mobile phones used by government ministers</a> and civil servants with immediate effect. Officials said the ban was a “precautionary move” on security grounds, and doesn't apply to personal devices. The British Parliament followed up by banning TikTok from all official devices and the “wider parliamentary network.” The semi-autonomous Scottish government and London City Hall also banned TikTok from staff devices. The BBC urged staff to delete TikTok from corporate devices unless they're using it for editorial and marketing reasons.</p><h2>UNITED STATES</h2><p>The U.S. at the start of March gave government agencies <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-united-states-government-ap-top-news-business-95491774cf8f0fe3e2b9634658a22e56">30 days to delete TikTok</a> from federal devices and systems over data security concerns. The ban applies only to government devices, though some U.S. lawmakers are advocating an outright ban. China lashed out at the U.S. for banning TikTok, describing the ban as an abuse of state power and suppressing firms from other countries. More than <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-united-states-government-china-privacy-26b0ee0d4c8421fa7f58b06f76651dc1">half of the 50 U.S. states also have banned the app</a> from official devices, as have Congress and the U.S. armed forces.</p>]]></description>
